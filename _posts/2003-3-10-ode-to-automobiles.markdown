<p>I've had shitty luck with cars lately. My transmission died about a month
ago and it cost an arm and a leg to get fixed. During my month of
carlessness I began carpooling with my girlfriend to and from work/school.
This was cool for the first two weeks, but she ended up getting sideswiped
by a gigantic truck and we were out of cars to use. We kept carpooling and
used my brother's car for four days, in those four days I managed to skid
off of an icy street(the only days the streets have been icy all year) and
land myself in a muddy ditch. At that point I about lost it, and decided
cars just weren't for me, reality set back in and I realized I have to get 
around somehow. My parents ended up going outta town and we borrowed their
car for the remaining week and a half. I finally got my car back this
morning, and all is well, hopefully...

A friend from school who recently graduated sent me <a 
HREF="/words/contemporary_computer_science.txt">this</a> the other day and
it made me think a lot about the degree I'm receiving from my college.
Especially since they just moved away from starting people with C/C++ to
Java since they think people learn better starting off with objects.

I changed the look of my site slightly, this was the first time I got to
change the layout without a gigantic backend overhaul and it was kinda nice
to be able to do that. Spring break is here, and I'm hoping to finish a
paper on putting <a href="http://www.openldap.org">OpenLDAP</a> to work, and
setting up C and C++ libraries for ipod interaction. It'll basically be an
abstraction of the itunes work that's gone into <a 
HREF="http://gtkpod.sf.net">gtkpod</a>. I'm also hoping to get caught up on
my sleep over break, thus far I'm failing miserably.
