title: Exam Time
---
I took my assembly exam today, so that's done. I redid the look of my page yet
again, hopefully this one will stick around for a while. Trucker messed with an
image I made last week, and after a few modifications of his version I came up
with the logo above. I'm not going to take Calculus 2 this summer, instead I'm
doing an independent study on software development which I know I'll enjoy much
much more. Hmm.... I haven't had much time to code lately so my little projects
are sort of in limbo, but if I ever finish them I'll put them up for download.
It's friday SOOOO I must drink mass quantities of beer, peace.
