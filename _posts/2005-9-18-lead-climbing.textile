title: Lead Climbing
---
I fell half a dozen times leading yesterday, but I'm kinda glad I did.  I know if I stay aware of my surroudnings and climb safe that falling while leading isn't gonna kill me.  I'm definitely stoked that I got to experience a whole new aspect of climbing, and it gives me an excuse to get more gear now. fwiw I lead some 5.8 and 5.9 routes, which if you're into climbing are complete newb route. :)
