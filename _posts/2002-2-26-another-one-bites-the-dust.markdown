title: Another one bites the dust
---
<p>I came home yesterday evening with dinner, and began eating.  After 
a few minutes I heard this annoying ass beep that wasn't going away.  My 
UPS was beeping away letting me know it wasn't getting juice from the 
wall.  After resetting it; machine number one powers up, my desktop.... 
doesn't.  I haven't tried pulling everything outta the machine yet and seeing 
if it'll work piece by piece, but I'm pretty sure I'll atleast be replacing 
something.  I kinda have a few things I need to get off my lazy ass and do 
this week, so I haven't bothered troubleshooting it yet. Life marches on, 
spring break is next week and I'm looking forward to some time away 
from thinking about school.</p> <p>Might be taking a trip upto <a href=
"http://www.cs.kent.edu">Kent</a> next week to look at grad school even 
though I'm still a year off.  It'd be nice to be outta Memphis for a few days, 
even though I'm prolly going down to Atlanta later in the week to check out 
the <a href="http://www.skatepile.com">Skatepile</a> competition and 
see some old skating friends.</p>
