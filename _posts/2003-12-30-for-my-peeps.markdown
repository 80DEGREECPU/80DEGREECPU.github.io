<p><B>FUCK,FUCK,FUCK</B>.  Being broke sucks, I have no cigs.  I do however have a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> theme(<a href="/images/gentooed1.jpg">1</a>,<a href="/images/gentooed2.jpg">2</a>,<a href="/images/gentooed3.jpg">3</a>) for <a href="http://xcomputerman.com/pages/entrance.html">Entrance</a>.  I got excited after <a href="http://www.pandora.la">Pandora</a> rendered me a 3d spinning Gentoo logo, and Entrance's presence in portage has led to some useful feedback we might not have gotten otherwise.  It required a little work in <a href="http://www.gimp.org">The GIMP</a> to modify some images from <a href="http://tokyo.cored.org">Tokyo</a>'s Ecdysis e16 theme, but it's more or less complete now.  It comes in three flavors, <a href="/files/gentooed.tar.gz">CPU Intense</a>(spinning 3d logo & eet only), <a href="/files/gentooed-lite.tar.gz">CPU Lite</a>(no spinning logo & eet only), and <a href="/files/gentooed-src.tar.gz">Gentooed EDC source</a>.  I used some non-free fonts here, 563caps and Hoog, so you'll need to find those yourself.  If you know of some good looking free fonts that I could distribute <B>WITH</B> that theme, feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.</p>
