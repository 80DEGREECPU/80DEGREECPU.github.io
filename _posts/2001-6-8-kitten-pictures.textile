a little <a href="/zelda/">Gallery</a> is available with pictures of zelda, 
so if you wanna see her she's there along with a few other things I've 
taken photos of the past few days.  I had my first expierience with imovie 
and firewire the other day which was actually quite pleasant and VERY 
easy to setup.  <a href="http://www.cyberquirky.org/misc/
misc_index.html">Funny Ads</a> I ran across yesterday.  I have to learn 
how to parse xml with <a href="http://xmlsoft.org">libxml</a> this 
weekend so I should be kinda busy. =(
