<p>After a nice long Christmas break everything is starting to go back to normal.  Allison and I went home to Memphis for the holidays, and it was definitely and adventure.  It took us 5 hours to drive 300 miles, and 3.5 hours to do the last 60.  It started sleeting in Memphis about the time we left Atlanta, and by the time get got close to Memphis we were driving on 3-4 inches of ice.  Since it was after 1am, and we were averaging about 15mph with approximately 40 miles left in the trip we pulled over and got a hotel room.  Between the jack-knifing tractor trailers, cars skidding off into the median, and my windshield freezing(despite the defroster being on full blast) we feel like we made the right decision to pull over and get a room.  The ice kept us more or less confined to our relatives houses which turned out to be quite pleasant.  Just our luck it didn't start melting until the day we left. :)</p><p>On the E front things are moving at a pretty steady pace.  e17 is becoming more and more useful, <a href="http://www.rephorm.com">rephorm</a> and <a href="http://www.everburning.com">dj2</a> are working on an <abbr title="Instant Messenger">IM</abbr> client called express.  Entrance currently has a wonky issue we're trying to sanely address involving <abbr title="Pluggable Authentication Modules">PAM</abbr>.  Sebastian Dransfeld submitted a patch that <a href="http://www.xcomputerman.com">xcomp</a> disagrees with(rightfully so).  The documentation seems to hint that we should be able to handle this sanely, but we've yet to decide on an approach to this.  I spent a little time over the weekend helping <a href="http://www.codewordt.co.uk">HandyAnde</a> address a few issues in the pager code he added to e17.  It basically stopped segvs in certain cases and a few other minor things.  I'm not 100% sure the modifications I made were right, but raster said he was gonna go through the pager code once he's done with <abbr title="Gadget Manager">gadman</abbr> anyways.</p><p>I've been learning <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> over the last week, and I'm pretty impressed.  While it wasn't the easiest thing to pick up, the constructs of the framework are quite nice for database powered websites.  I'm building an app at work to address some scattered data we have, and the more I play with it the cooler it seems.  My one gripe is that it seems slow during "development" phase, but apparently there's optimizations you can put in place when you put it into "production".  I haven't made it that far with my app yet. :) I might end up rewriting my website in it in the next few weeks.  It shouldn't take that long either.  I'm becoming more and more fond of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a> these days.</p><p>I've been tinkering with the <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> distribution on my laptop and workstation recently, it's pleasant to be on something <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> based again.  For the most part I'm happy with it, but you still have to fetch a few things yourself, mplayer, lame, etc.  It's kinda weird getting used to compiling e code into /usr/local again, been compiling --prefix=/usr on gentoo for so long I forgot what /usr/local was for... :)</p>
