a bunch of smaller things I've been working on came together the other day and 
now I have a nice little configuration tool for e17, called <a href="/ecc">ecc</a>.  
Menus and Keybinds and focus settings are what you can do now, but there are still 
more user configureable dbs to look at so I'll see what's in those next.  I've got a 
good handle on <a href="http://www.gtk.org">gtk+</a> programming now too. =)  
Other then rain in memphis, nothing much is up.  I've been skating every friday for 
the past few weeks at the park, <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net">Cozmo85</a> 
took a <a href="/misc/?im=me_180.jpg">photo</a> of me.  He's actually been 
taking a lot of <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net/photos">photos</a> with this new 
camera he got.  By the way I have the <B>best</B> <a 
HREF="/misc/?im=Bridie3.jpg">dog</a>.
