title: os x lives ?
---
When I got my ibook a few weeks back I was initially impressed with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a>, but after playing with it for a few days the useability of it kinda wore off.  Last night I installed the latest quake3 patch for OS X and battled <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net">a friend</a> demolishing him 15 to -3 =).  Mobile quake3 is umm, neat.  I also learned to deal with Classic mode and found a lot of my classic apps run much more smoothly then their "designed for Mac OS X" counterparts.  SuSE 7.1 for ppc is still running great on the ibook, I just want sound support....  My CS assignment for school is coming along really well, and I learned first hand the beauty of the design phase of software development.  We had spent the past few weeks designing our system, but found part of the software we were using wasn't going to accomplish what we needed.  Since we had written a relatively small amount of the code the setback is almost non-existent.  I've taken <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> off my desktop and opted for <a href="http://markybobdeb.sourceforge.net/zoltan/">Debian with Reiserfs Support</a>.  No more painful fscking for me =)  I'm currently updating updating my page from a console browser as I've been entirely too unmotivated to setup <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">XFree86</a> the way I want it.  <a href="http://www.eatsleepcode.net">Allen</a> hacked together a pretty neat page last week, check it out if you have a minute.  I sorta changed the navigation of the site last week sometime by adding a <a href="/misc/">Misc</a> section which contains crap that should be available but didn't have a proper section to add the links.  I might be bringing my cam back online sometime soon also because it appears that philips cams now are supported right in kernel 2.4.5.  So ends this novella update.
