title: Me vs. vfork()
---
vfork() is a pain in the ass to implement, I have to implement vfork in <a 
HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html">MINIX</a> as my last assignment for the 
semester in operating systems.  Other then that the semester is wrapping up and I 
have 2 exams left to study for.  I modified <a 
HREF="http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/vz13/">Vlad Zbarskiy</a>'s warnback 
plugin to work with the latest versions of gaim.  Basically it sets it up so if you get 
warned by someone else it warns them back 4 times immediately and adds them to 
your denied users list.  You can get a newer version than he has available <a 
HREF="/files/warnback-src-0.5.tar.gz">here</a>.  <a 
HREF="http://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a> got drag n drop support 
added into the filemanager windows the other day.  It's working really well so far, I'd 
put up a screenshot but you can't really appreciate drag n drop unless you actually 
mess around with it.  Other then that I'm looking forward to goofing off and drinking 
excessively over christmas break.
