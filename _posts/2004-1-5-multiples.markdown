<p>My desktop is dead.  I had a really annoying and loud fan for a few weeks, and decided to replace it with a gift card I got for christmas.  I apparently didn't seat the heatsink properly because after a few seconds it smelled like someone was soddering things.  The top of my Athlon had black marks in places. So I reseated the heatsink a little more carefully, it booted, and it ran through the night.  I decided to play some quake the next day, and about 2 minutes into a game it crashed, and the smell was back.  It's won't boot anymore, but  I think all I'll need to replace is my CPU.  For now I've been using my Vaio a bunch and I'm finally at the point where I've gotten used to it and really like it.  Despite the fact that it's gigantic.</p>
