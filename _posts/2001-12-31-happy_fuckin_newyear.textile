Here is a brief run down of christmas break.  I have yet to complete my paper for Dr. Maletic, I got an <a href="/misc/ipod_and_cam.jpg">ipod</a>(it's pretty fucking neat), a <a href="/images/aba_3_liter.jpg">3 liter bottle</a> of <a href="http://www.arrogantbastard.com">Arrogant Bastard Ale</a>, and I've been working on a bg lib for E.  I somehow came across <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org">Linuxprinting.org</a>, <a href="http://www.smokinweed.org">Spence's Page</a>, <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a>, <a href="http://www.va2600.net/blaim/">a blowfish encrypted aim plugin</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/CVS-RCS-HOWTO-3.html">a CVS How-To</a>, <a href="http://www.inner-smile.com/bsd.phtml">a BSD Tips page</a>, and <a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/"> a sane procmail quickstart</a>.  Lots of links to useless crap, unless you are a <a href="http://www.linux.org">lunix</a> user, then it's <B>good</B> shit!<BR>
In completely unrelated news, I went to a party/rave/show last night and saw <a href="http://www.perfecto-fc.com/">Paul Oakenfold</a>.  I had a fucking blast, good friends, good atmosphere, and good music.  The set was seriously more then I expected, and it was well worth the money.<BR>  So Christmas has come and gone once again.  This year was kinda funky though, it didn't really feel like Christmas, then it did, then it was over.  C'est la vie.
