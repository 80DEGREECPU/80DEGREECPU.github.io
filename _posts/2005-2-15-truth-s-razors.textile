<p>Very little forward progress on the coding front except for work related stuff.  My scripts and apps at work are in great shape. :)  Haven't really found much time to code on E things lately though.  Have ideas and things I want to get done, but sometimes it's hard to sit down and get into something when you go 2-3 days without touching it.  "Now where was I..."</p>
