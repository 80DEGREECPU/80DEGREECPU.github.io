title: my memcached tasks
---
I wrote some "capistrano tasks for memcached":http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2007/2/18/bust-a-cap-in-dat-ass and put them on the caboo.se blog.  "defunkt":http://errtheblog.com swallowed them into "cache_fu":http://require.errtheblog.com/plugins/browser/cache_fu a few days later. \o/
