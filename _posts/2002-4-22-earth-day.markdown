title: Earth Day
---
<p>Atleast I think its Earth day today.  I had a very crazy Saturday at a 
friend's last weekend.  Day-long festivities were topped off by mud 
wrestling at the night's close.  I think <a href="http://

earth.  </p>  <p>I finally motivated to getting about 80% of  my projects 
done which takes a giant weight off of my shoulders.  a few more days of 
classes, a week of exams, and then atleast 3 weeks of relaxation.  I 
should probably decide whether or not I'm going to take summer courses, 
but I see no real need to rush. =)</p>
