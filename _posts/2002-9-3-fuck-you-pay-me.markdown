title: Fuck You, Pay Me
---
<p>If I remember right, that quote is from good fellas.  That's seriously what I feel like <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Redhat</a> is saying with their up2date stuff.  Browse through the <a href="https://rhn.redhat.com/index.pxt">RHN</a> pages if you give a shit.  Basically you can update one system for free, otherwise they want money.  If you're not a paying customer don't expect up2date to work when that errata message arrives in your mailbox, they reserve those busy times for the paying customers.  The errata mailings are great don't get me wrong, but then you have to grab all of the rpms manually. <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> has never looked better, but then again redhat never looked good to me.  I can't seem to convince my boss that we should move away from it, they like the simplicity of point and click configurations of computers.  It seems like more and more often I'm required to setup Redhat boxes and go through the hoops and hurdles of applying the errata shit.  It sucks.</p>
<p><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/rewriteguide.html">mod_rewrite</a> is fucking badass.  I moved 90% of my old content to this new backend thing over the weekend.  Still needs some work, but for the most part I'm much more content with it, and it should all be able to <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validate</a> as HTML 4.01 now I think.  What else... I got a Geforce4 MX 440 dual head card a week or two ago, the thing is great for two monitors.  All the stuff xinerama used to do for me in software is done in hardware courtesy of this card.  I took a big time cut at work for the sake of my studies(and partially my sanity).</p>
