I drank too much beer tonight.  I puked all over The Flying Saucer and got away
with it.  =)  Someone told me this evening they were impregnated with their own
future.  I think there is a lot of truth in a statement like this.  We are
becoming where we're going.  The potential of that future is all what we make of
it.  Goodnight.
