<p>School starts tomorrow.  I'm dreading it, I had a lot of fun over break.  I've finally gotten my desktop setup, and I'm getting a new hard drive this week a western digital 100gig with an 8MB buffer.  I'm looking forward to upgrading from a 472k buffer that's been in there for the past few months.  I did get to keep the systems at school on Debian.  I hate Solaris with a passion, but it finally started cooperating late last week.  Should be very cool for us in the future.</p>
<p>Go checkout <a href="http://gtkpod.sourceforge.net/">gtkpod</a> from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=67873">cvs repository</a> if you have an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> and use it under linux, or know anyone who would test it under linux.  It's seriously in great shape, handles everything you need to manage an iPod and it's built with <a href="http://www.gtk.org">Gtk2</a>! =)
