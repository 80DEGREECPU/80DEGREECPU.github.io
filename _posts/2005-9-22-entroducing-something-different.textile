title: Entroducing Something Different
---
I'm a "DJ Shadow":http://www.djshadow.com fan, I gobble up everything I can.  So "jvhoorhis":http://jvoorhis.com pastes this link on IRC the other day which is totally worth checking out.  If you've ever spent time listening to Shadow's "Entroducing" album, this will likely impress you.  "The Shadow Percussion Project":http://www.brianudelhofen.com/DJshadow.html and the available "video":http://ia300108.us.archive.org/2/items/BrianUdelhofenTheShadowPercussionProject/spp.wmv.
