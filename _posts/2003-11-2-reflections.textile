<p>So this thing is three years old already.  Checkout <a href="/news/2000-11-02/1/">the Beginning</a>, <a href="/news/2001-11-09/1/">the 1st year</a>, <a href="/news/2002-11-02/1/">the 2nd year</a>, and <a href="/news/2003-11-02/1/">the 3rd</a> if you're bored.  This also means that I'm 24 today.  Seeing your age as you get older, realizing that you're still working towards your goals, and you still don't have shit to show for it is kinda depressing at times.  Bleh.</p>
<p>School blows right now.  I've got presentations and projects piling up, lots of them are poorly defined.  Every teacher trying to bleed you dry for your best work, and they seem to never understand how time consuming their projects are.  Everybody now! <B>Fuck</B> School!  Ahh... Now don't you feel better?</p>
<p>I whipped up a little <a href="http://xcomputerman.com/pages/entrance.html">Entrance</a> theme by swapping out a few of the variables in the Nebulous theme in <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">e</a>-cvs.  You can grab it <a href="/files/MoonClouds.eet">here</a>.</p>
