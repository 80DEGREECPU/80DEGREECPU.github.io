<p><B>My intermittent internet connection</B>.  My <a href="http://www.directvdsl.com/">DSL</a> connection is coming and going every 30 minutes or so.  I haven't been online talking to anyone, I've actually been spending a lot less of my free time in front of the computer lately.  I'm currently working on a Database project for a class.  I'm using <a href="http://www.postgresql.com">Postgresql</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net">php</a>, it's ok I guess.  The weird thing is I'm moving.</p>
<p>a whole bunch of weird circumstances led me to believe it'd be a good thing to move in with my girlfriend, this girl Allison I've been seeing daily since we went to the fair about two months ago.  It should be really cool moving into her house for a few reasons.  I get to bring <a href="/bridie/">my dog</a>, I have a bigger room, and I'll be around her without both of us having to frantically track the other one down in the evening so we can hang out.  I'm looking forward to it cause I have a feeling it'll be an interesting expierience.  This however means I'm ditching this intermittent dsl crap, and I'm moving my webserver to a box at <a href="http://www.memphis.edu">school</a>.  I wonder how long till they notice and get mad.</p>
<p>I managed to learn a little more about setting up a <a href="http://www.beowulf.org">Beowulf</a> cluster at work.  I've got a neat little setup with two ghost images.  One for the server, and one setup as a dummy node.  The cool thing is you can add as many dummy nodes as you want to the network, and all you need to know is the dummy nodes mac address.  With a few minor modifications to the dhcp and dns servers it can support upto 253 nodes which seems like enough from my perspective.  They're running <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>(because it rules and you know this!), and if you're looking for a little tutorial on how to setup a beowulf cluster on Debian you should check out Adam Powell's <a href="http://lyre.mit.edu/~powell/debian-howto/beowulf-start.html">tutorial</a>.
