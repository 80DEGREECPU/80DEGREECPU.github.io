title: Rest and Relaxation
---
I took some time off from messing with things I've been toying with lately.  Slept a lot and BSed a lot occupying my time with nothing productive, and it was wonderful.  I came across quite a few things that I found intersting in the past few days.  <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1142540&lastnode_id=22163">Lab Keyboards</a> is a cool piece of writing I came across on <a href="http://www.everything2.com">Everything2</a> the other day, it's even funnier if you've spent time in college computer labs(especially the ones in Dunn Hall at the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu">UofM</a>).  <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/08/23/pirate/index.html">Fingered by the Movie Cops</a> is a thought provoking little piece I came across a few minutes ago.  It's written by a girl who's boyfriend was directly accused of violating the <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1142540&lastnode_id=22163">DMCA</a> and how crazy shit is involving things like this.  <a href="http://www.workingmac.com/igeek/36.wm">OOD vs. API</a> is a dope read if you code.  Since I've been in college all I ever freaking hear is OO this and OO that.  The article isn't anything you've never thought before, but I thought it was one of the better things I've read in a while, perhaps because I agree with him. =)  <a href="http://www.getrewted.org">getrewted.org</a> is an interesting site <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Niekze</a> pointed out to me the other day, it has a patch you can use to add all kinds of neat features to your kernel, like randomized pids, buffer overflow protection and a bunch of other shit, I actually installed it with <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>-2.4.9 the other night, it's kinda neat.  Oh yeah, and a <a href="/sshots/atmos-08-16-2001.png">screenshot</a> of e17 with scrollbars and the <a href="/edock">edock</a> app I play with every once in a while.
