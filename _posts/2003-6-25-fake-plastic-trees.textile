<p>Summertime is pretty nice.  The nasty sticky part of summer is about to kick in, but early summer in Memphis can be quite nice.  I got to meet <a href="htttp://www.twistedpath.org">Term</a>(from #edevelop) a week or two ago when he was in Memphis on work, he seems like a really cool guy, and it's nice to be able talk about programming and computers with people.  He pointed out I smoke a lot.  =) Other than that I've been playing entirely too much <a href="http://www.quake3arena.com">q3a</a>, but since summer classes are shifting gears towards busy I decided to "rm -rf /usr/local/games/quake3".</p>
<p>I spent some time playing with <a href="http://evidence.sf.net">Evidence</a> recently too, and I was lucky enough to find a nice entry to point to hack my way into it.  It's a pretty simple hashing mechanism to cache thumbnails generated by the filemanager, and it conforms to the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">Free Desktop</a> <a href="http://triq.net/~jens/thumbnail-spec/index.html">Thumbnail Management Standard</a>.  <a href="http://www.azundris.com">Azundris</a> accepted the patch, and cleaned it up so it looked more like the rest of the code in Evidence.  It sounds like a lot more than it was, but I got to learn some <a href="http://www.libpng.org">libpng</a>, and felt somewhat productive.</p>
<p>Raster has gotten his Edje idea out in the open and after <a href="http://www.rephorm.com">Rephorm</a> was nice enough to explain a few things to me I started moving epbbuttons to it.  I might need to put linux back on my iBook to test it  out once I get the layout and animation done.  Hopefully I'll post a new version in the next couple of weeks.</p>
