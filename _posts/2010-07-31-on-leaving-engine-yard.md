title: On Leaving Engine Yard
excerpt: Why I'm leaving, What I'm Doing

So I quit working at Engine Yard
================================

I talked to my boss yesterday and explained that August 13th would be my last
day at [Engine Yard].  A whole lot of crazy shit has gone down at work over the
past few months and there's a few more amazing things they haven't announced
yet.  About a year ago I packed up all my shit and moved to SF because the
company was in really bad shape.  Things have been shaken up recently and
Engine Yard is finally back on track to becoming a great company.

As an early employee I was privy to a bunch of stock that has, for the most
part, vested.  So in the choice of "wait out for the last 25% of my stock" vs
"moving onto something new and exciting," I'm choosing the latter.  3.5 years
is a long time to stay at any job, and I want to be a part of something new.

As we grew from fewer than 10 people to almost 90, I've seen a lot of
organizational restructuring.  I really don't want to work in a corporate
environment, and I have for the better part of a year.  A corporate environment
is pretty unavoidable if you've taken as much VC as EY has.  It's something
I'll think long and hard about if I ever find myself building a company that is
going to take venture capital.

However, I'm grateful to have been a part of such crazy growth with so many
amazing customers and co-workers.  I'll miss my coworkers more than anything.

The AppCloud Team
-----------------

The people working on the [appcloud] product are the best team I've ever been a
part of.  It currently consists of these members:

* [sr]
* [geemus]
* [benburkert]
* [smerritt]
* [larrytheliquid]
* [martinemde]
* [adelcambre]
* [halorgium]

They're pretty much the shit.  They're also [hiring] if you're interested.

Where I'm Going
---------------

I don't actually have anything lined up.  I know I want to work less, so I'll
prolly do some contracting for a while.  I'll be available for contract work
starting mid August.  [Holler at me] if you're interested.
