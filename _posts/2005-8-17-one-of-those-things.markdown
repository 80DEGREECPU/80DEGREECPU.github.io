title: One of Those Things
---
"#45 Work vs. Progress":http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay45.htm was a pretty insightful.  I think every manager I've ever had could really benefit from reading it and possibly implementing some of the ideas.

Another little gem of Scott's is "How to survive creative burnout":http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay33.htm.  I read through it a couple months ago and it hit pretty close to home.  I had become more or less uninspired to work on "E":http://www.enlightenment.org and my projects at work.  Instead of getting down on myself for my lack of participation, I've kinda come to peace with knowing that it happens sometimes.

It sounds simple enough, but when you see your "fellow hackers":http://www.edevelop.org pushing code to cvs daily it's easy to get discouraged.  What used to come so naturally, suddenly doesn't sound like fun.  I've done this prolly twice since my initial involvement with E.  I did this after ebony/ebindings (during  "raster's":http://www.rasterman.com evas rewrite) and during my involvement in "gtkpod's":http://gtkpod.sf.net infancy.  I'm not going "completely inactive":http://www.mandrake.net, but I do realize I have little drive to actively work on E related things right now.

Lately I've just been writing various things in "ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org, "rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org, and hacking "typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com.  I've found that this change of pace has rejuvinated my love of programming, has given me insight into aspects of programming I'd never given much thought to, and probably made me a better programmer.  We all thought "Tilman":http://www.code-monkey.de was smoking something when he wanted to do ruby bindings for E, I prolly wouldn't have picked up the language if he hadn't.
