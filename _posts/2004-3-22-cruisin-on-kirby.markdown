<p>Andy is all moved in. I'm installing Linux on his desktop, and we picked up a Motorola Wireless Bridge from CompUSA yesterday.  Hopefully it'll work properly, I haven't gotten to test it yet.</p>
<p>I sent out more resumes this morning, I'm wondering if people advertising in the newspaper call you back, most of the jobs I've applied for through <a href="http://www.monster.com">Monster</a> don't ever contact me.  On the bright side my car is getting its thermostat replaced today, so if I do manage to find a job I have a way of getting there. :)</p>
<p>I've been working on a pure edje smart object that's a file save/load dialog.  It looks like <a href="/images/esmart_fd.png">this</a> right now, but like all these other Edje based things it's themeable.</p>
