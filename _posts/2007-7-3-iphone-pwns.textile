<h1>iPhone pwns</h1>

So I contained myself all day on friday and didn't wait in line for an "iphone":http://www.apple.com/iphone/.  At about 6:45 I decided that I'd go check out the closest AT&T store to see if I could get one.  I walked in and out in about 10 minutes with a 4GB model for the sane? price of 500$ US.  I went home, activated the thing, waited, waited and waited some more.  After about 2 hours I called support, "i can has iphone?" and they replied "you can has iphone in 6 hours!"  So I waited 6 hours, only able to slide the little touchscreen over to pretend like I really needed to make that emergency call.  After the 6 hours past I thought "fuck this" and went to sleep.  Needless to say I refreshed my email entirely too often for a while and my iphone(which was purchased on a friday) didn't work until Sunday morning.  Two days without a phone is kinda creepy in this day and age, especially when it has all sorts of nice features you wanna fuck with. :)

All that other bullshit aside, it's *fabulous*.  Everyone who takes my phone from me can figure it out.  I'm delighted by the intuitive UI and the integration with my mac.  The keyboard took me a little bit of getting used to(I came from a blackberry), but that's the only thing I've remotely struggled with.  Well done apple!  I don't feel like it was a waste of money, I'm delighted with my purchase but I only wish it would've started working sooner.
