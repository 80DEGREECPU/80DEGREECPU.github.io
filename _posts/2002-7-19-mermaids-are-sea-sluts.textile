title: Mermaids are Sea Sluts
---
Went to the beach.  Had a good bit of fun and relaxation.  Some of the pictures are up <a href="/images/beach-2002/">here</a>.  I read neuromancer and started reading snow crash.  Both are pretty interesting books.  <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com">Neal Stephenson</a>, who wrote snow crash, has an interesting read on what seems to be operating systems, it's kinda long, but been funny so far.  I've mirrored it <a href="/files/command.txt">here</a>, hope that's not copyright infringement.  I take a little bit of time last week to hack up elogin some.  I'll hopefully commit those changes in the next few days.</p>
<p>They should run <a href="http://www.debian.org">debian</a> at work.  The Dell servers come with <a href="http://www.redhat.com">redhat</a>, and I swear they must believe that it'll only run redhat well.  Been learning a bit more iptables lately though.</p>
<p>This week has been weird.</p>
