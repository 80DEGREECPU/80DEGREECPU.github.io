title: ibook and OS X
---
My ibook arrived.  I have prolly done nothing more than eat and play with this
thing since I got it, and I do sorta like Mac OS X.  <UL>Pros<LI>UNIX: it's here
manpages compilers and shell scripts =)</LI><LI>Internet Exploer + Plugins: When
push comes to shove IE owns the browser world</LI><LI>iTunes: mp3s/rip/burn
cds/mp3 players/audio cds plus visual stuff</LI><LI>MySQL + PHP: It was a synch
to get php and mysql up and running with the built in apache</LI><LI>SSH: It
fucking comes with <a
HREF="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a></LI><LI>Compatability: No more
grumbling over something arriving in Word Format etc. </LI>
</UL><UL>Cons<LI>SLOW: Mac OS X is by far the slowest window manager/shell I
have ever used</LI><LI>Terminal: Supposidly you can get syntax highlighting in
it with vim, I have yet to get this working, colors in the term are
non-existent</LI><LI>DVD: I can't watch dvds, must boot to OS 9 for
this</LI></UL><BR>
So those are my pros/cons after my first 48 hours of owning an ibook with os x.
 I think it's not too bad in all honesty.  It's hellatiously slow, but nothing
has crashed in OS X yet.  Networking and stuff isn't quite <a
HREF="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> but I think I've gotten the hang of
it.   <a href="/files/rc.firewall.osx">Firewall Script</a> is available and
kinda designed for web/ssh/ftp in on the machine.  <a
