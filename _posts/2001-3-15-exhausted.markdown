I stayed up really late setting up a server for a friend.  I did however learn
bind and sendmail over break which is definately cool to add to my "shit I can
do" list.  My little app idea is actually coming along quite nicely, as I am
pleased with what it's giving me thus far.  I will prolly also be helping
maintain the <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">Enlightenment</a> web page
in the future as the developers are too busy to maintain it themselves. 
<B>Links:</B> New <a href="http://somethingawful.com/jeffk/">jeffk</a> cartoon
is <a href="http://somethingawful.efront.com/jeffk/jeffbezzos/">here</a>.  If
you've never visited <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">Kuro5hin</a> it's a neat
little site with a ton of shit.
