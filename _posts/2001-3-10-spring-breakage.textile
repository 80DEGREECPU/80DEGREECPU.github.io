title: Spring Breakage
---
So Spring Break is here.  This means sleep, lots of it.  It also means I get
some time to code things I've been meaning to get around to.  <a
HREF="http://www.thedukeofurl.org/reviews/misc/tribes2preview/">Tribes 2</a> for
Linux review is up at <a href="http://www.thedukeofurl.org">The Duke of URL</a>
and it looks pretty impressive.  <a
HREF="http://www.nostatic.org/grip/">Grip</a> users can't connect to CDDB
anymore, I've been using grip for a while now and this kinda sucks. =( 
Regardless the next 8 days are going to be pure relaxation.  Peace
