<p>Since I don't have as much free time as I did a year ago, I spend a lot less time syncing cvs and compiling the <abbr title="Enlightenment Foundation Libraries">EFL</abbr> as the changes come in.  I wrote <a href="/files/scripts/update_e.pl">a little perl script</a> that syncs with cvs and only builds the libs that've changed since the last time I synced.  It also supports interactive compiling of all the libs in correct order, sudo, etc.  Kinda handy when I want to sit down and work on <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">e</a> stuff. :)</p>
