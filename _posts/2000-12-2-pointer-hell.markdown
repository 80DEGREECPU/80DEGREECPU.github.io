title: Pointer Hell
---
I'm <B>REALLY</B> enjoying my last CS assignment for the semester.  It's a pointer problem, and I'm getting pretty sick of it.  I am actually making descent progress, it's just frustrating at times.  I played with <a href="http://www.muhri.net/skipstone">Skipstone</a> for a while last night, and can't get it to compile against M18 or the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> cvs.  I get undefined references, the joy of doing things from source I suppose.  If you haven't seen Skipstone before it's a lightweight browser written in <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK</a> using the gecko engine mozilla runs on.  I have however managed to get a binary working, and it's running really well.  So I may use this for everyday browsing for a while.
