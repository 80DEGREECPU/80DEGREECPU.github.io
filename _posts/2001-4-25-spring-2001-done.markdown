title: /*Spring 2001 Done*/
---
So Spring 2001, my sophomore year, is done.  I just turned in my last 
assignment and classes have commenced.  Just exams ahead of me.  I *may* not 
be taking calc 2 this summer, I might swap it out for Software development 
under a teacher I'm really interested in taking it from so it should be really 
cool if it all pans out.  Bleh.  This semester kicked my ass.  18 hours adds 
up at times and I'm glad it's over.  I am really looking forward to some free 
time even it's only for 4-5 days before summer session starts.  What else....
