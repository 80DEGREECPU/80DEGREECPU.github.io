title: Citronella
---
<p>Insects thrive in Memphis in the summer, citronella stuff works wonders =)  Break has been extremely cool.<p>I went to the Memphis in May Musicfest last weekend and had a pretty good time.  I saw Incubus Saturday, which was a seriously dope performance, and Stone Temple Pilots on Sunday.  The festival was basically a shitload of drunk and/or crazy people going to see rock acts.  I overheard some of the craziest shit walking around, next year I'm bringing some way to tape video or audio.</p><p>I've been helping some friends build a deck for the past two days, that's been pretty fun.  Power tools, hammers, and constructing stuff can be extremely fun.  I've also been spending a little time on Elogin which might one day become useful.</p><p>After spending the past 2 months or so on my Ibook I've finally found a way to get all of my Apple keys working in Linux, <a href="http://www.cymes.de/members/joker/index.html">PBButtons</a>.  I can finally adjust the contrast and brightness without having to reboot to OS X(which I deleted after school ended).  It'd be really nice if I could get my ipod working in Linux.  It seems I have to send my ibook back to apple yet again, since the guy at the Apple store told me my battery is broken, and I have 7 days left on my warranty.</p>
