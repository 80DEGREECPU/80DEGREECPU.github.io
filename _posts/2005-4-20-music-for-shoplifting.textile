<p>I have been a busy busy bee lately.  Unfortunately, none of my hard work has been going towards open source coding. :'(  However quite a few things changed since my last updated, and I'll do my best to bring the world up to speed.  Allison and I are being exercise freaks still, and we've both taken a liking to climbing the rock wall at our gym.  It's like a big kids jungle gym. Happy 4-20 :)</p>
<p>I wish I had better things to say about my involvement with <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">enlightenment</a> these days, but I haven't had a ton of time.  What I was working on with entice last month panned out quite well, but there's still quite a bit left before it'd surpass the current version in reliability and usefullness(two things the current version is lacking greatly if that puts anything in perspective).  I'm hoping to work out more things in the weeks to come, but I'm well past the point of getting down on myself for lack of participation.  The rest of the folks have been busy as hell, and have you seen <a href="http://www.get-e.org">get-e</a> yet?</p>
<p>A few weeks back I upgraded <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">RoR</a> on my webserver, and my website quit working.  Unfortunately I was really busy at the time, and just left it broken for a few days.  In the process I realized how much I had missed out on since RoR 0.8.5 which was my first taste of the framework.  Use <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com">FastCGI</a> if you're using apache, seriously.  There's also this <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/XmlHTTPRequest">Ajax</a> stuff that arrived in the recent versions, and it's made me rethink bits and pieces of web design.  In a nutshell you can dynamically link to or update chunks of (x)html code based on the id of the tag, and it's fucking braindead using rails.  After spending a bit of last weekend tinkering with it on my personal site, the app I whipped up at work earlier this year(ePLM Scout) is getting some badly needed love.  I've also integrated this updated version with <a href="http://www.netegrity.com">Netegirty Siteminder</a> for all of my authentication needs.  It's nice being able to restart pools of load balanced appservers via a webpage, but now the question is "how long till I can manage my intranet servers from my <a href="http://www.rim.com">Blackberry</a>?"</p>
