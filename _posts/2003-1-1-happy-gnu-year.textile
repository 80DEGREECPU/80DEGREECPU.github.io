<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Happy Birthday to Benny(the 25th) and my Mom(the 23rd).  Christmas break has been really fun.  Spent a lot of time with Allison, and it's been really cool to hang out with her without school assignments lingering in the back of my mind.  We spent Christmas morning together at her parents and went to mine later in the afternoon.  The day after Christmas we hopped on a plane with the rest of my family and went to Washington DC.  Did a whole bunch of family shit, showed her some of the more common sights of the town, and got to see my friend Regan who is about eight and a half months pregnant.  All in all it was a little too much family time, both parents, all five kids, one niece, and one girlfriend made for crowded times.</p>
<p>I've been hacking like a mad man on <a href="http://gtkpod.sourceforge.net/">gtkpod</a> for the past two weeks.  What we're currently working on is available in CVS and the features just keep coming.  Allison is getting to witness me being a big geek first hand.  She seems to be taking it really well.  Time for coffee and code....</p>
