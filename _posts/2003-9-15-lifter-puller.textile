<p>For some reason I've been really excited lately.  September seems to have brought with it a few new albums by some of my favorite musical artists.  <a href="http://www.aperfectcircle.com">a Perfect Circle</a>, <a href="http://www.rhymesayers.com">Atmosphere</a>, <a href="http://www.outkast.com">OutKast</a>, <a href="http://www.erykahbadu.com">Erykah Badu</a>, and <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1278143">Aesop Rock</a>.  I've also managed to dig up a few cds that had been missing from my collection courtesy of <a href="http://www.undergroundhiphop.com">UndergroundHipHop.com</a>.  God I love music.</p>
<p>It looks like I'll probably be going to look at <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu">University of Texas Austin</a> next month.  I don't know if I'll get in or not, but the program looks quite intriguing.  I'm still looking at <a href="http://www.cs.kent.edu">Kent</a>, and a few other schools, but for now I need to keep my mind on this semester which is looking quite cool.  My networking and programming languages classes started out painfully slow, but my Models of computation class is seriously cool.  I'm hoping to be able to do further work on the predicate logic stuff I did last spring for my logic class, i.e. devise a method to automate and possibly check fitch natural deduction proofs.  I'll need to get it approved, but it sounds sane perhaps.  I played in a disc golf tournament over the weekend and ended up getting 8th. =(  I did however win my entrance fee back by winning the "Ace Pot" which is basically a hole in one competition.  It's such a fun game.  Allison and I are coming up on a year of being together, which is very cool.  I suppose we've decided that <a href="/news/2002-09-30/2/">September 30th</a> is our anniversary.  Both of us are to broke to do anything fun, but we have each other.  Which despite the cliche, works for us. </p>
