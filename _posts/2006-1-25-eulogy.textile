"Eulogy":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349416/ is the funniest movie I've seen in quite a while.  I can't remember the last time I burst into laughter that often in one sitting.  To top it all off "Joey":http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0103038/ from "Hackers":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/ is in it! I *highly* recommend this movie. :)
