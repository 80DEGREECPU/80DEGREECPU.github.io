title: Monsoons in Memphis
---
We've had thunder and lightning in Memphis for about 2 or 3 days, plus really
hard rain.  I leave the day after tommorow for my sister's wedding in Texas
which should be interesting to say the least.  I have to meet with my teacher
about my independent study tommorow and take my dogs to the kennel.  I added a
screenshot section <a href="/sshots">here</a>.  It's done with this neat little
php script that generates really nasty looking thumbnails but gives it's a
gallery style display which is kinda nice.  I received my copy of <a
HREF="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a> today along with a rio600 and a
printer.  The rio600 is a neat little thing I just wish it had more space, I got
6 whole mp3s on it!  They need to realize that no one rips their songs to wma at
32kbps most are mp3 at 192 and it just doesn't cut it.  I might look into
expanding the memory though because it's neat. I want my freaking <a
