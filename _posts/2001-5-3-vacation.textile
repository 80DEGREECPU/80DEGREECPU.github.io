title: Vacation
---
Exams are completely finished, today is the first full day of summer vacation. I *think* I have about 3 weeks off before summer classes start. This weekend is the Memphis in May <a href="http://www.memphisinmay.org/Beale/">Beale Street Music Festival</a> which should be pretty fun to check out. I ran across <a href="http://www.stallman.org">Richard Stallman's</a> webpage today.  This is the guy who founded the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU Project</a> it's an interesting little site he has which is pretty cool to check out.  I'm so freakin exhausted it's insane, and my sister is getting married later this month....
