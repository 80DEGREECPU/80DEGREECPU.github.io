We caught "Atmosphere":http://www.rhymesayers.com the other weeks on their "Pour Me Another" tour.  Slug was playing with "Blueprint":http://www.weightless.net and POS.  As expected, all three acts and the vibe in the club were great.

All of last week Allison was trying to con me into going to Mississippi to attend a family friend's party.  I did that drive so many times last year that I still hate it with a passion.  My friend Chris from work was down for the adventure, and after a few beers on Thursday they'd sold me on the idea.  The selling point, I'd get to try out my new "tent":http://www.marmot.com/products/product.php?cat=tents&subcat=1&style_id=G2715.      Here's a brief rundown of the weekend's events:
* Leave Atlanta 8:45PM EST Friday night
* Arrive at my parent's house in Memphis 2:00AM CST, head to the casinos with Chris shortly after.
* Arrive at the Casino's in Tunica at 3:15AM.  Play poker for the next few hours only to break even.(This was my first trip ever to a casino)
* Arrive back at my parents about 9:00 AM, hang out with my parents
* Shower and sleep at 11:00AM
* Wake up to "pnuma":http://www.pnumamusic.com practicing in the room over my parent's garage at 1:00PM
* Hang out with my brothers for an hour, leave for MS at 2:30PM
* Arrive in Holly Springs MS at friends farm, setup our tents, wander around, have a beer, mingle, eat, and crash out around midnight.
* Wake up at 6AM to a frost covered tent, and a sunrise.  Go back to sleep until 9AM
* Eat a tastey breakfast and get on the road about 12PM CST, drive back to Atlanta, arriving at about 7:PM EST

I slept like a rock Sunday night.
