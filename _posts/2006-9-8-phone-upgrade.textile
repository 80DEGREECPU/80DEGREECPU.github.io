title: Phone Upgrade
---
About a month ago my Blackberry 7290 quit getting reliable reception.  I'd *never* had any problems with the phone up until then and even when I was visiting Atlanta it wouldn't let me talk more than 45 seconds or so without dropping calls.  I took it into Cingular and they tried to get me to renew my service and get a more modern blackberry.  While the phone made a lot of sense while I was at GE, I really didn't need a wallet phone anymore.  So I went looking on ebay...  

There were only two requirements, one of which I could deal without if I found the right phone.  Mainly I wanted something that worked well with my mac via bluetooth, and the other was a keyboard for text messaging(yes the blackberry spoiled me).  Most of my friends with Motorol Razrs hate them, and the other 'popular' phones were either more than I wanted to spend or pushing features I didn't foresee myself using very often.  I remembered "my friend Roy":http://redx.be hyping up "bluephoneelite":http://www.reelintelligence.com/BluePhoneElite/ a while back, so I looked at what phones would work well with it.  One of their well supported phones looked really dope, a "Motorola A630":http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=66.  I found one on ebay, brand new, for a little more than 100$.  Wow oh wow, I'm absolutely hooked on bluephoneelite.  It's so dope when I get a phone call, the caller id is displayed on-screen, and my itunes pauses when I answer it.  It'll put my machine into screensaver mode and shuts off itunes when I walk out of range.  Equally cool is when it starts it back up when I walk back in range. :)  They're really really simple interactions with my computer that are just convenient.  I love it.

Syncing my contacts from my Blackberry wasn't as straight forward as I thought it'd be.  Unfortunately the A630 doesn't work with isync by default.  "PocketMac":http://www.pocketmac.net/ did a decent job of putting all of my blackberry contacts into my mac address book, isync just refused to connect to my a630.  I found a great "write-up on syncing the a630 with isync":http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2005071122352210 on "macosxhints":http://www.macosxhints.com/ and now all is well.
