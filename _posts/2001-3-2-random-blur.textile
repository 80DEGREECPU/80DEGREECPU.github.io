I changed the way the site looks today with only modifing a very small amount of
code which was pretty dope.  It's got a white feel to it, and soft gray which
makes it easier on my eyes, I think..  I'm working on setting up my <a
HREF="/webcam.html">Webcam</a> again.  I'm retarded and the new version of camE
doesn't like me too much.
