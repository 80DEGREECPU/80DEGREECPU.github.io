title: More PHP Fun
---
I've been playing with PHP a lot over the past few days, and I'm really starting to like it. I started messing with forms and stuff, along with including other files, and a few more database things.  I added the two new bars to the left one showing the 7 most recent apps released on <a href="http://freshmeat.net">freshmeat</a>, and the 6 most recent stories on <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.  I also added a local search for no real reason but to learn how to use it.  I don't have a single interesting link or funny photo, to share, except <a href="/images/officeassistant.gif">this</a>.
