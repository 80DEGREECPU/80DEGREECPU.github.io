I've been climbing a shitload and absolutely loving it.  Our friends have been patient enough to take us out climbing and camping which Allison and I have been really greatful for.  We've mainly been doing 'sport' climbing and 'bouldering'.  Apparently if I can get strong enough in the months to come, they're going to take us 'trad' and 'slab' climbing too.  When I'm not climbing I've been swimming or running daily.

I'm planning on updating more frequently and making the updates less long winded.  Starting now... :)
