title: The Slacker Strikes Back
---
<p>The pathetic mess that has become my website got a band-aid a few minutes ago.  I <B>finally</B> fixed the ugly ass journal/news header font dealy 
thingies.  They've been bothering me for a while, I didn't do anything about it, I'm still not too happy with it, but they're <B>less</B> ugly.  I've actually been 
thinking about using flash, but doubt I'd ever do that.  I gave a talk on e17 at a <a href="http://www.golum.org">Golum</a> meeting the other day.  It was 
kinda fun, it kinda sucked, but I did it and the people there were pretty nice so oh well =)  I'm addicted to <a 
HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/arena/">Rocket Arena 3</a> again =(  I've been using my <a href="/webcam.html">webcam</a> again too, scary.  
New Years was fucking fun, went to my friend Erik and Vanessa's, lots of people, 5 djs alternating(which was seriously dope), and a keg =)</p> <p>  I went 
skating today, it's weird to go skating now, I actually went street skating, it'd prolly been 2 years since I've done that.  Going street skating, just cruising 
around the city and skating whatever crosses my path used to make me so happy, it's nice to see it still does.  The weird thing is I never really feel like 
skating, it's fun when I go, but it's been well over two years since I woke up thinking "man I wanna go skate."  I guess you can outgrow things, but that 
doesn't mean you have to abandon them(Thanks <a href="http://www.videogroove.com">Dave</a> for helpin me see that).  Skating was what kept me sane 
in high school cause(for me atleast) I fucking despised high school.  It was a legitimate excuse to get away from my nagging parents, I met <B>a lot</B> of 
good friends and a few bad ones, I got to travel,  and probably best of all I got to test and develop myself as an individual.  This tangent I've gone off on 
kinda stems from skating today and talkin with my brother last night.  He's 17 and has 17 year old male woes(pronounced parents).  To make a long story 
short he left home, I tracked him down, and we talked for a while.  He's not a bad kid, just makes shitty decisions at times, and hasn't learned to take 
responsibility for his actions.  He went home today, which is cool, I just really hope he gets on track.  I wish he had something like skating was for me, but he 
sorta floats from one interest to another and back again.  God I'd hate to be 17 again.</p><p>If you're reading this thinking, "god damn this guy is a sappy 
fuck"(or something along those lines), I've got three words for you, <B>Eat a Dick</B>.  If you do know where I'm coming from, respect. =) Gah, this is long 
update, I over abused smileys and bold face type, but I don't give shit, this <B>my</B> website and all. =)</p>
