title: Railsconf and Radiohead
---
After months of anticipations railsconf is upon us.  I arrived earlier this week and crashed with "tokyo":http://www.cored.org" for a few days.  We caught a "Radiohead":http://www.radiohead.com show and met "danp":http://www.dpiddy.net after the show for dinner.  The show was insane and I'm really glad we went.  

Fucking Railsconf.  It's insane.  I'd guess that half of the people have arrived right now and the network is completely saturated.  Every available seat in the bar area is filled with various macs.  I've seen *maybe* 1-2 pcs around the place.  So many of the people I've only known from IRC are here.  We all went into the city last night for some excellent chicago style pizza, and today we grabbed power strips and extensions cords.  This weekend is going to be nuts.
