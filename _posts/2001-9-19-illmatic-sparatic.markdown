So ladies and gentlement out of my own stubborness I am writing an aim
client with ewl whenever it is ready, and SuprGubr has to take a screenshot
of his desktop under lunix running my aim client with <a
href="http://www.goatse.cx">Goatse dude</a> as his background within 9
months of a stable release of ewl.  On a totally unrelated note check out
new pics of my <a href="/misc/?im=Bridie1.jpg">Bridie</a> and other animals
I've so heartlessly abandoned at my parent's house <a
HREF="/misc/">here</a>.
