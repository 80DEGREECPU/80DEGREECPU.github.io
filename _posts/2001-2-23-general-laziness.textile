So I've been extrememly lazy as of late, and haven't been updating my page.  I really haven't been doing all that much.  Allen and I wrote an image viewer with Evas and we learned a few new things.  Just turned in an Assembly Program and a Data Structures Program so I have a nice mellow weekend to look forward too.  I've only really found about 2 things that were of interest to me of late.  The first is <a href="http://somethingawful.efront.com/jeffk/dr-episode1/index.htm"> Jeffk</a> helping you not get h4x0r3d, and a few <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/screens.x/doom2k/New%2520DOOM">screenshots</a> of Doom 3.  Guinness toast tonight at the flying saucer =)
