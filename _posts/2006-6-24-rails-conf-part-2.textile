title: Rails Conf Part 2
---
The last two days have flown by.  Being surrounded by so many smart people is inspiring.  

Yesterday was kicked off by a keynote by "Dave Thomas":http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi which touched on a lot of interesting things, but stuff I really disagreed with.  He talked about a few things that I disagreed with, namely composite foreign keys and enhanced scaffolding.  For the most part it was a good talk and a pleasant way to kick off the weekend.

'AC/DC, Stavinsky & Rails' was given by Adam Keys which is definitely one of the best I've seen thusfar.  After that I saw David Demaree's and Stefan Kaes talks, I wasn't super stoked on either of those.  David's hit on a nice point of interacting and building web apps for technophobes.  Stefan's was cool but I'd read most of it recently in his InfoQ article.  "Amy Hoy's":http://www.slash7.com talk on overcoming scaffolding was humorous and even involved bonzai kitten. :)

Martin Fowler, Paul Graham, and _why the lucky stuff + the thirsty cups were the next three keynotes.  Martin was interesting for a bit, but I got kinda bored and ended up ordering pizza for everyone while it was going on.  We all(caboosers) grabbed some Chicago style pizza and had a cool little dinner.  Paul Graham makes me smile, but it was kinda weird to see him stand in front of us and use his notes so much.  _why and his band were hilarious, I really need to get my hands on some obedience lacquer. 

Rick & Charles gave their talk today and I ran into a guy immediately after that dug the talk.  I was kinda scared that people wouldn't get what they were trying to convey.  I didn't see them I checked out "ezra's":http://brainspl.at talk which was really well received and the Q&A seemed to go really well for him.  Mike Clark's testing talk was rad, and it was nice to see that we're on the same page with how we're testing at work.  After that we checked out "DHH's":http://www.loudthinking.com keynote which had some neat new features that're coming to rails.  He presented a bunch of new things, but the highlight was definitely "DHH Buzzword Bingo" which apparently was won by "Robby":http://www.robbyonrails.org.  

It's about 1am and a few of us are sitting around in the main conference room drinking a pitcher of bass ale debating an IHOP trip.  Railsconf is fabulous.  I wanna go to Railsconf Europe...
