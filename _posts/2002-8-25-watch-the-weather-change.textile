<p>Fall semester starts tomorrow.  I'm going to be busy as shit for the next few months.  I'm a little freaked out as to whether or not I'll do well, but I think if I can stay focused on school I'll be fine.  Plus there is always the wonderful dissatisfaction of shelling out entirely too much money for books.  I can't wait to be done with <a href="http://www.memphis.edu">school</a>.

<p>Website got a small makeover today.  Had some freetime while I was ghosting computers at work.  Finally got around to browsing this huge collection of treutype fonts, and I moved away from the black/gray look.  It was kinda cool that it's just <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">css</a>, and a little image path manipulation.  I actually have a whole backend rewrite sitting on my hard drive, it just needs another class or two written before I can move the full site over to it.  I've also made the <a href="/comics/">comics</a> page available, it's something I've been using for a while, it basically downloads and displays The Boondocks and Doonsbury for the day without having to look at 9 million banners.</p>
<p><a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net">Evidence</a> might be what old efm users might be looking for.  <a href="http://www.azundris.com">Azundris</a> seems to have a pretty good thing going on with it.  <a href="http://www.kevb.net">Kevin Brosius</a> has been playing with E a lot and has migrated most of e's cvs tree to evas2.

<p>The girl I had fun with in DC has a name, it's Holly.  I didn't go out of my way to show her this site, I kinda went out of my way to watch my tongue and not mention it.  Something doesn't sound right in "Hey wanna see my website"  She found it anyway.  Today is her birthday, happy birthday. =)
