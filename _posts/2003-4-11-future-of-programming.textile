title: Future of Programming?
---
<p>If you code <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">this</a> is neat.  What'll programming languages be like in 100 years?</p>
<p>I setup <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/">ipf</a> in <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris 9</a> today at work.  I really wish I had done this sooner, it works perfectly.  There are even <a href="http://www.maraudingpirates.org/ipfilter/">binaries</a> available. =)  It's a shame you can't get <a href="http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html"> pf</a> for it.</p>
