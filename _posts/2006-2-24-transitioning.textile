You'll notice my site is uglier than normal, and that most of the links and stuff are gone or inaccessible.  I moved off of typo and on to mephisto.  My site was broken because of a few things that didn't go smoothly when updating to typo trunk. :)  So instead of having an older site that was broken I figured I'd move to a new site that was broken.  I can now say "Yeah I know it's ugly and borked, I'm upgrading" instead of saying "yeah that uh... doesn't work right now, I haven't cared enough to fix it."

New job is cool thusfar, will post more stuff when time permits.  I miss my girlfriend a lot, and I leave work exhausted every day.
