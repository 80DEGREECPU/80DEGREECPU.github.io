<p>I've been doing a lot of homework lately, and a little bit of coding. Working on a gui editor for edje, and migrating entrance to edje. <a href="http://xcomputerman.com/pages/entrance.html">Entrance</a> will be super themeable, complete with animations and all. Imagine a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/">flash</a> based login daemon, without sound, but you can seriously make the user interface do whatever you want provided to you follow a few basic themeing rules =). Development around #edevelop is quite fun lately(PANTS OFF!) as everyone has their own little projects they're working on, and there's lots of toys to play with. I'm currently functioning off of about 2 and 1/2 hours of sleep cause I stayed up late hacking and Allison woke me up crazy early with some coffee. Next week my course load doubles and I doubt I'll have as much time to code, but who knows. August 15th is summer session's final destination and I'm ready to work my ass off through that date.</p>
<p>I've been playing with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> at work quite a bit. In the past I'd only been fond of it for <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=40551">NAT</a> boxes and such, but I've managed to get the E cvs tree built on it, and I'm tempted to give it try at home for a bit. I'm not sure when I'll have time to do it, but it'd prolly be a pretty fun switch. I managed to mangle my apt database really bad, not once, but twice! in one week. I'm now on a fresh <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> stable system and once again all is well. I really want a new iPod. Linux fails to recognize mine these days, so I've gone back to using it with <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>, I'm not very happy about this at all, I'd <B>MUCH</B> rather use <a href="http://gtkpod.sf.net">gtkpod</a>. Anyways, I'm off to try to enjoy my weekend.</p>
