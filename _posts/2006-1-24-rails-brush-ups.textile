title: Rails Brush Ups
---
I've been brushing up on various little things in rails that I was rusty on or never fully took the time to grok.  Here's a few useful links I found along the way.

* "Rails Development":http://www.railsdevelopment.com/2006/01/15/effectqueue/ has a cool writeup on "Scriptaculous Effect Queues":http://wiki.script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/show/VisualEffects, "obie":http://www.obiefernandez.com is using them in a cool "javascript slideshow":http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2006/01/19/easy-scriptaculous-slideshow.
* "Cody's RJS Writeup":http://www.codyfauser.com/articles/2005/11/20/rails-rjs-templates is a wonderful intro into rjs, "technoweenie":http://rails.techno-weenie.net also has a cool writeup on "rjs forms":http://rails.techno-weenie.net/tip/2005/11/29/ajaxed_forms_with_rjs_templates.  
*  I have now seen the light and don't forsee myself using "habtm":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#M000474  any time soon.  There's new cool things in edge rails, association proxies.  There's a pretty cool writeup I found on it "here":http://www.matthewman.net/articles/2006/01/06/rails-activerecord-goes-through
