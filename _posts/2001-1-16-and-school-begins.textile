title: And School begins.....
---
<a href="http://www.efnet.net">Efnet's</a> website got hacked.  It's all black and says "IRC is LAME. Go watch TV." You can check out <a href="http://smokedot.org">Smokedot</a> for a good laugh, it's a slashdot clone for potheads.  The first topic I noticed was "Ask Smokedot: What Things are Better Done NOT Stoned?"  I'm pretty content with all the stuff I learned over break.  I can now write ghetto C apps, code php, and I've got 2.5 years of school left to learn a ton of other shit.  Peace.
