<p>Been busy coding <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>.  Rewrote all of my current <abbr title="PHP Hypertext Processor"><a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a></abbr> site in <abbr title="Ruby on Rails"><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">RoR</a></abbr>.  I didn't have much of a problem finding ruby modules for all of the extensions I use with PHP(exif, gd, curl) were all easy to locate and use.  This is actually my first update from the new interface. :)  Working on a neat rails based web app for work to manage our <abbr title="Quality Control">QC</abbr> servers with Ruby <a href="http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/">Net::SSH</a>.  Other than that I've been resting, taking some photos, and hanging out with Allison.</p>
