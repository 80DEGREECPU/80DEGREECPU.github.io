<p>So I ended up doing a lot better than I thought I would on my database midterm.  The group project for the db class is starting to come together.  I somehow conned my group into using <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> and C++ though I'm not sure how fluent they are with it.  They suggested VB and Access but that made my stomach churn, they musta seen how sincerely grossed out I was by that idea cause they eventually caved in.  The project is due November 15th(I think) and we have <B>a lot</B> left to do.  I dropped calc2 last week cause it was a burden.  I feel kinda lame for dropping it, but it required more time then I was willing to offer it this semester.  I wanted to make sure I could spend enough time on this database class, and they offer calc2 every semester.  Anyways, school is much more manageable now.

<p>I'm going to DC this weekend to visit my friend Holly.  We're going kayaking and to an atmosphere show so it should be rather cool.  I'm not sure how comfortable it'll be though.  I've been kinda preoccupied with Allison, the girl I went to the fair with, we've been hanging out pretty much every day.  I haven't the faintest idea how this whole ordeal will pan out.  I have no idea why I'm putting this on my website either, other than to look back at it in a while and laugh, it's not like more than 5 people read this crap anyways.

<p>I decided to give <a HREF="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> 3.2 a try on my ibook, and I was pretty impressed.  The way they're doing wireless in obsd quickly has become my favorite.  Installing via ftp over wireless is cool as shit to say the least.  Downside was there is still no proper apm support(sleep doesn't work), and I don't have sound support.  I'm <b>almost</b> tempted to take a stab at working on it, but I can't right now I really need to focus on school(copout?).  <a HREF="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a> was a bit akward, and I've posted my OpenBSD 3.2 <a HREF="/files/XF86Config-ibook-OBSD3_2">ibook2 XF86Config</a> file cause I couldn't find one on <a HREF="http://www.google.com/">google</a>.  Anyways I think it'd be cool to run obsd on my ibook eventually, but a few days away from linux left me longing for <a HREF="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>.
