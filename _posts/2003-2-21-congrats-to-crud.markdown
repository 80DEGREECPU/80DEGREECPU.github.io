title: Congrats to Crud
---
<p>The one and only crudmonky got accepted to the <a href="http://www.umich.edu">Univerity of Michigan</a>'s phd program for computer engineering.  The weird thing is I've never actually met crud(Matthew Martino), but we've spent countless hours on irc chatting.  While he's been an annoying asshole sometimes, it's always been apparent that he's a really smart guy.  Back in the day I knew him as this guy who terrorized tons of channels just for the hell of it, but he was a regular in #oldlinux on the undernet.  He started at Penn State the same time I started at the U of M and we always seemed to be awake doing homework at 2am together.  I'm excited for him and wish him the best of luck in pursuing is goals.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.skatepile.com">Skatepile</a> team will be in Memphis tonight skating at the <a href="http://www.skateparkofmemphis.com">local skatepark</a>.  I'm gonna go check it out, and say what's up to some old friends who should be there.  It's weird how I've skated like twice in the past 6 months.  Sometimes I forget how happy skating used to make me, but I just don't seem to make any time for it anymore.  Kinda lame.  Anyways it's friday, and I'm cutting outta work early cause I have nothing to do.</p>
