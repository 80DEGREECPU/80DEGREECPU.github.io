<p>So I got a job this morning, it's doing java coding for a professor I used to do some admin work for.  The work environment should be cool, and I'm anxious to start(and have an income again).  I get to work on a Linux workstation. :)</p>
<p>We went to Spence and Kristin's, wedding last weekend.  It was at the Pink Palace in Memphis, which is a pretty interesting local museum/mansion type place.  It was a really nice wedding, everything seemed to be perfect for them.  I put some photos of the wedding up in my <a href="/gallery/">gallery</a>.  I couldn't help taking these pictures at the Museum though, a <a href="/view/images/shrunken_head.jpg">shrunken</a> head and <a href="/view/images/shrunken_head_recipe.jpg">the recipe to make one</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still hacking my way through the file dialog in edje thing.  It's coming along quite nicely, a <a href="/files/esmart_fd.mpeg">movie</a> of it in action is available.</p>
