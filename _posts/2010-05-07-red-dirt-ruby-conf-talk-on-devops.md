    I posted my slides from red dirt rubyconf. It's about the devops movement
    that's been gaining a lot of momentum in the sysadmin circle.  A lot of
    people at the conference asked me about the source of the images in the talk,
    they're from <a href="http://blackandwtf.tumblr.com">blackandwtf.tumblr.com</a>.

  <p>
    Red dirt was a pretty damn good conference.  The format was different than
    I'm used to and I believe it worked out quite well.  It basically took 4
    speakers on similar subjects, the first speaker had a 30 minute talk, the
    last 3 each had 15 minute talks.  During the talks a moderator, 
    <a href="http://twitter.com/jeg2">@jeg2</a>, collected questions in the IRC
    back channel and the presenters would answer the questions after everyone
    finished their talks.  The location was good, the food was only second to
    <a href="http://twitter.com/alohaonrails">@alohaonrails</a>, and the vibe
    of the attendees was overwhelmingly positive.  The only negative thing I
    have to say is that the talks are going to be sold instead of shared, I'm a
    big fan of sharing.

    I really wish conferences would just stream their talks and think of the
    conference as an experience for the attendees, making it more than just the
    talks that are valuable.
