title: Paint in your hair
---
<p>I've had paint in my hair for the past few days.  In an effort to make living at Allison's more comfortable I've started taking the steps necessary to get my room in order.  Unfortunately this required me to start by painting it.  It's gray and white and should look much cooler when it's done.  I'm enjoying my break from school and spending what time I can squeeze in working on <a href="http://gtkpod.sourceforge.net">gtkpod</a> still.  Hell even <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Puckett</a> submitted some hashing code that proved to be quite useful.</p>
<p><B>They let me put <a href="http://www.debian.org">debian</a> on the servers I take care of at school!!!</B>  My boss finally decided to read up on it and was like "wow, yeah let's try it out."  <B>/me tries systematically migrate all the linux systems at school to debian</B>.  Oh happy day happy day. I'm gonna graduate in 12 months hopefully, but for now I think I'm getting sick...</p>
