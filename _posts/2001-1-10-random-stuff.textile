Hmm, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla 0.7</a> is out it's running really well so far.  I did some work on myclock-v0.05 last night, actually made some progress but I'm not getting the whole Atom thing with wmhints and stuff.  <a href="http://www.evilwalrus.com">Evil Walrus</a> is a cool PHP resource.  I read <a href="http://www.thecomicreader.com/html/icst/icst-5/icst-5.html
">this</a> last night, and it seemed like an akward idea. About paying per visit and stuff when you visit an artists site.  It's kinda of a cool idea, I just think it'd be hard to setup validation and prevent spoofing.  Somehow I ended up on <a href="http://www.soulxchange.com">SoulXChange</a> the other day, and it's pretty fuckin weird, you can like sell your soul online and watch it's value rise.  Other people can buy stock in your soul or something I dunno....
