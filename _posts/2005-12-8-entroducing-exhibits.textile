title: Entroducing Exhibits
---
"Xenith":http://xenith.org and I were both working on different photo gallery software simultaneously.  We decided to join forces a month or so ago, and we're nearing something releaseable.  "Trac":https://svn.xenith.org/exhibits is available as well as "svn":https://svn.xenith.org/svn/exhibits/trunk.  We'll probably have a formal release in the next few days.  It's been a long time comin.  A lot of "flickr":http://www.flickr.com users have wondered why implement something that's inferior to flick?  My answer is this:

* You can host it yourself
* You can modify it to do your bidding
* It's free
* It's been a fun distraction from everything else
