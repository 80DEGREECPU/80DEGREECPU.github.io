<p><B>HOLY FUCKING SHIT!</B> It's looking like I'm going to graduate in a week
or two. I'm about to head into school for what's hopefully my last
undergraduate class. The dirty feeling I got from installing Windows XP
on my laptop is still lingereing, but <a 
HREF="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> will hopefully make its way back
on there in the next 24 to 48 hours. This last month has been 
<B>HARD</B>, read papers, write papers, write code for people who keep
changing requirements on you, try to spend time with girlfriend but too
distracted by the previous three things to make it work well. I wrote a
few edjes for <a href="http://www.rephorm.com">Rephorm</a>'s <a 
HREF="http://rephorm.com/rephorm/code/iconbar/">iconbar</a> as a tension
breaker here and there, you can snag them from my <a
HREF="/code/">code</a> section. I'm so exicited about the upcoming
weeks, hopefully it'll consist of eating, sleeping, coding, and spending
time with my girlfriend. Tomorrow is her birthday, she'll be 25.  I wish
I wasn't so broke, it'd be cool to take her out and do something fun.
</p>
<p>Now I'm including the following simply because I wrote it the day
after it happened, and I'd probably end up deleting it at some point.
Basically I was invited to a house warming party at my Calculus2
teachers house, and this is what happened(as I remember it).

Ok, so we showed up at Jeff's about 8:30 pm.  Neither Allison or I had eaten
anything since about noon, there's a keg of <a
HREF="http://www.rogue.com/brews.html#hazelnut">Rogue Hazelnut Brown</a> and
a bunch of food.  There were bunches of people around, and Jeff got Allison
and I glasses.  Near the keg was my friend Dave who I've spent countless
hours outside of the math/cs building at school talking, smoking, and
drinking coffee.  We took a seat on a porch swing not too far from the
little bondfire Jeff had setup, and talked with Dave and various others for
a bit.  Dave apparently had brough some <a
HREF="http://www.rogue.com/brews.html#crusty">Old Crustacean</a>, which
needed to be sampled.  It's tasty and kinda thick, reminded me of <a
HREF="http://www.arrogantbastard.com">Arrogant Bastard Ale</a>.  Anyways I
also ended up taking a large shot of <a
HREF="http://www.jackdaniels.com">Jack Daniels</a> with Dave, and continued
drinking off of the keg.  So of course I got louder and louder, and more and
more retarded the more I drank.  Sometime around 10:30 or so most everyone
had migrated inside, and for some strange reason I felt compeled to kick one
of the hay bails into the bondfire, and man those things go up quick.
Luckily Dave was on firefighter duty and came to the rescue with a hose, it
was out before half of the bail went up in smoke.  Dave left right after
this.  So I hung out around the fire with various mathematicians, still
drinking more beer.  Allison was talking to various other people, and I
do vaguely remember leaving.  Then voila!  I woke up this morning, kinda
scary.  Things I learned from this, or should've remembered from
previous experiences include</p>
<UL>
<LI>Eat food before you drink.
<LI>Don't take shots of Jack Daniels alongside high alcohol content beer.
<LI>Don't throw bails of hay into suburban bondfires.
<LI>People accept apologies.
<LI>Romanian Mathematicians seem to like AC/DC
<LI>Jeff Wheeler drinks good beer.
</UL>
