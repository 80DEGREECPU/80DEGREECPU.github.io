So [Tim](http://spork.in) and I were talking about how we needed
[hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com) for our rack apps the other day.  This [rack
hoptoad notifier](http://github.com/atmos/rack_hoptoad) should get you going
for [rack](http://github.com/rack/rack) and
[sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com).  Raise
[issues](http://github.com/atmos/rack_hoptoad/issues) on github if you run into
problems. :D

If all you want to do is install the gem you can install it like this:
`% sudo gem install rack_hoptoad`
