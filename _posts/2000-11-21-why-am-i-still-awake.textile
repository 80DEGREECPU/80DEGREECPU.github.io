title: Why am I still Awake?
---
More sleepless nights.  I guess I underestimated my physics workload and noticed at around midnight there was no way in hell I was gonna get it done.  So once again I stayed up all night finishing shit I should have started way earlier.  I think this whole college thing is just bloating you up with shit to do, see how much of it you can get done, and break you in to be a slave in the rat race.  I could be wrong though.  I just started messing with cgi stuff and perl cause I want a more dynamic way for me to update this page than hacking the index.html everytime. It's like 7am and I don't wanna do these last two physics problems, and I have a test in physics in 4 hours. Only 4 more classes till <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=NODE+Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> break though.
