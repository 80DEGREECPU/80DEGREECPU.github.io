title: Ugh.... School
---
School starts in two days.  This is a general education semester(non major related stuff), except for compilers!  a lot of people might think that this is sick, but it's something I wanna learn about.  The only good thing that's happened recently is I got a job.  I'm working at school doing all sorts of shit with <a href="http://www.linux.org">Lunix</a>, this should be really cool.  <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net">Coz</a> moved to Nashvegas(as he affectionately calls it). I forgot to mention that when he did, he was nice enough to give me an 18 gig drive on his way out, thanks man.  <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Niekze</a> seems to be moving his site over to <a href="http://scoop.kuro5hin.org">scoop</a> for more functionality with less overhead.  My web stuff has been moved off of my nat box and onto a server I'm sharing with him, so if shit ever goes wonky with my page, blame him, it's prolly his fault!  I watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0068646">The Godfather</a> DVD collection yesterday and today, it's got all three plus your typical bonus crap that dvd collections have.  I don't think I'd ever seen all of them in their entirety before, so this was cool, I really enjoyed em.  I stripped down my <a href="/?p=links">links</a> section cause Ben and Allen don't really maintain their stuff, and it's kinda pointless linking to an apache start page(Ben!).
