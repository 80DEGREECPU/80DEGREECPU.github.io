I just took my french final so school is officially done.... for 2 weeks.... then it starts back 
up again.  Aside from that I've been coding a bunch.  I finished the menueditor I wrote 
with evas, it's <a href="/files/evas_med-0.01.tar.gz">here</a>.  I also couldn't sleep 
last night and hacked the saving/loading of e17 menus into e16menuedit, it's available

other such things to share.  So with this update done, I'm going to go drink a tasty <a
