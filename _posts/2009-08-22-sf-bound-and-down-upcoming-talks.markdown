I'm moving again.  As much as I love Boulder, I'm moving to SF to be closer to
[Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com).  After years of telecommuting I find
myself wanting to work with people in person more and more.  Boulder is, and
probably will remain, 'home' to me now.  I don't want to leave but [joe
arnold](http://joearnold.com) has really created an attractive environment in
SF and it's the type of development environment I feel that I'll learn a lot
from.  Boulder is probably the most inspirational place I've ever lived.  From
the spiritual folks to the athletes to the artists, the community is vibrant,
creative, and caring.  I'm really gonna miss it. :'(

I'm going to be speaking at three conferences over the next few months so I
figured I'd mention them here.

I'm going to be speaking at [the ruby hoedown](http://rubyhoedown.com) in
August on "how to be simply awesome."  It's basically a run down of how
[halorgium](http://github.com/halorgium) and I are winning on the regular.
Unfortunately I won't be there for the full conference because I'm catching a
plane to Austin later that night.

The next day in Austin I'll be presenting at <a
href="http://lonestarrubyconf.com/">Lone Star Ruby Conf</a> on the same topic
with a slightly different title.  I'm hoping my connecting flights allow this
to happen because I'm pretty excited about the subject.  I just gave the talk
internally at EY and it needs a little work but I think I finally understand
how to present the topic to people.

**I'm speaking at [a conference in HAWAII](http://alohaonrails.com)**,
aloha on rails.  I'm doing a talk on open source software and independent hip
hop label's evolution over the last decade or so.  I'm gonna do my best to not
come off like a marketing douche bag, but I'm going to present a bunch of
similarities between open source craftsmanship and successful indie rappers.
You should go come!  I'm hoping to get some surfing in, let me know if you're
interested!
