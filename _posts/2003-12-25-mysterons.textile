<p>Merry Christmas!  Happy birthday to Ben, he's a Christmas baby and always seems to get website well-wishing.  My mom's birthday was two days ago, and that's always neat.  Puckett is home for the holidays, good to see that he hasn't changed a bit.  <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net">Roy</a> has been in town too, Roy is one of those people you can't help but laugh and have a good time with.  Spent time with my family and Allison's today.  It's nice how the holidays bring people together, even if you're not remotely religious.  I, as a broke ass, didn't get anyone anything for Christmas.  Maybe by this time next year I'll be able to.</p>
<p>I graduated.  It was met with little celebration since I didn't walk or send out invitations.  I did make straight As though, that's a first for me.  No immediate grad school, taking the year to study on my own and look at other places that might be better for my interests.  I've been sending my resume to places around town, and thusfar only one bite.  They were impressed(I think) when I went in and met them, but it's doing <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> work.  Doing web development as a job doesn't sound very fun, plus this job had "undefined" system administration responsibilities.  "You *<B>might</B>* have to drop what you're doing(work) to do X or Y on occasion."  Fuck that, no offense to any sys admins that might read this one day, I'm a programmer.  If you think my time is best spent moving computers, and fixing people's application problems, you're painfully misusing me as an employee.  I'll prolly have a follow up interview next week sometime, I still have no idea what they pay.  The really sad part is I need a fucking job, I'm broke and in debt. :(  It's weird how for the last year I regularly had conversations like this.</p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Someone</B>: "When are you graduating?"
<LI><B>Me</B>: "Dunno"
<LI><B>Someone</B>: "I'm sure you will, and you'll get a good job when you graduate!"
<LI><B>Me</B>: "Ok...."
</UL>
<p>Now my conversations with people go like this.</p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Someone</B>: "You graduated?"
<LI><B>Me</B>: "Yup"
<LI><B>Someone</B>: "So do you have a job?"
<LI><B>Me</B>: "Nope"
<LI><B>Someone</B>: "Anything on the horizon that looks good?"
<LI><B>Me</B>: "Nope"
<LI><B>Someone</B>: "Well I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding a good job"
<LI><B>Me</B>: "Ok..."
</UL>
<p>Maybe I need to work on my communication skills.  Maybe I need to bloat my resume up with tons of buzz words so I look like a better prospect.  Maybe I should just deliver pizzas and work on <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">E</a>.  It's a shame there aren't any companies out there interested in supporting <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/team.html">our developers</a>.  Anyways, enough of the depressing job hunting shit, I've been coding in my new found free time.</p>
<p><a href="http://xcomputerman.com/pages/entrance.html">Entrance</a> got a new theme this past week, and some <a href="/docs/entrance/index.html">documentation</a> on the theme format.  It consists of three examples, basic, medium, and complex. :)  If you're curious what this new theme looks like, I have a low quality <a href="/files/entrance.avi">mockup</a> of it, but the theme is more complex than what you see there.  Most of the feedback I've gotten has been good, atleast on the looks of the theme.  Now that we have another theme, and some documentation there are ideas that need to be implemented in the Entrance client.  Hopefully that'll be done by sometime next week.</p>
