  <p>
    I posted my slides from POSSCON.  The goal of the talk to let
    student and educators know that school alone isn't going to prepare you
    for real world software development.  A few people came up to me
    after the talk and said "I don't know what school you went to, but I
    could program when I graduated."  When I asked him if he knew how to
    write software when he graduated, he paused and then he smiled.  I
    don't think Open Source or Education alone will prepare you, but I
    really think they help.  Here are my slides.
