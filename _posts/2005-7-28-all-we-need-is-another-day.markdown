title: All We Need is Another Day

I hacked together a simple "irssi":http://www.irssi.org script that displays what you're listening to with "xmms2":http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Main_Page in the channel you're on.  Simple, hackish, annoying to most, but was a fun change of pace.  It's available for "download":/files/scripts/xmms2.pl


I'm off to go climbing in "Little River Canyon":http://www.nps.gov/liri/ with some friends for the day. :)
