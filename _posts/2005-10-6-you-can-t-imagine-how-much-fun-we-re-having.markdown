title: You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having
---
I've been a fan of "atmosphere":http://www.rhymesayers.com/ for years now.  Before I spent time on computers I could be found with Overcast in my discman.  Over the years I've seen the group that impressed me at a small show in Minneapolis develop into an indie rap powerhouse.  They released a new CD the other day "You Can't Imagine How Much Fun We're Having":http://www.rhymesayers.com/releases.php#rId_75, and it lives up to exactly what I'd expect from the group.
