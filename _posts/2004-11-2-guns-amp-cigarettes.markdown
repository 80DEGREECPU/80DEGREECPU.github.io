<p>Happy Birthday to atmos.org.  It's four today, and coincidentally I'm
25.  I guess I should feel old, but for some reason I don't.  I got
the best damn birthday present an engaged guy could get, Allison moved down
to GA last weekend.  We still need to go back to Memphis to grab a few large
things(washer, dryer, couch, etc), but we had a very productive move of
small items last weekend.  </p>
<p>Enlightenment cvs has been really active lately.  <a
href="http://www.code-monkey.de">Tilman Sauerbeck</a> is always busy, but
he's done wonderful things for Edje lately.  He added all kinds of checks to
the edje compiler that make the themer write more correct markup.  This
ended up making all of us notice what broken edje code we've been writing
for the past year or so.  I'm surprised some of my stuff ever worked.
He's also got these ruby modules, that are making me really want to learn
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>.  
<a href="http://www.rephorm.com/">Phormie</a> has been working on a nice
Entrance theme, check it out <a

sure to check out the latest <a
