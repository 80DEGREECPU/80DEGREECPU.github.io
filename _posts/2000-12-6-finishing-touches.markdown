Today is the last day of classes for the fall semester, only thing left is exams next week.  Few things I've found in the past few days <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/story.cfm?sid=1864">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.titaniumstudios.com/games.html#quake">Quake on Dreamcast</a>, <a href="http://firefly.sparse.org/~mrt/cgi-bin/t.cgi?field=atmos.yi.org">If Mr-T Made atmos.org</a>. For some strange reason I've been up all night again toying with my final CS assignment, I'm getting really good at this, it's like 6:30am. On a totally unrelated topic I think it's really weird that one of my sisters is gonna get married...
