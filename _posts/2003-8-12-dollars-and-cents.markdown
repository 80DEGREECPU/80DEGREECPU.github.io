<p>Summer semester only has two days left, I'm so excited.  I've taken my calc final, and I have my linear algebra final in two days.  At this point I don't care how things turn out, I just want them to be over.  Thursday night we're leaving when Allison gets off of work to go to the beach.  We'll only get two full days there, but I'm really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Today kinda felt like christmas.  I got my student loan money for the summer last saturday.  I couldn't access it until today, so of course I went and bought some stuff.  I got a <a href="http://www.richsawin.com/vaio/">Sony Vaio FR130</a> and a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPod</a>.  I haven't gotten my laptop quite yet, but it's on its way.  Apparently this new iPod doesn't work so well with the conventional way of running an iPod under linux.  I'm hoping to figure out what's wrong really soon because my iPod hard drive is  as big as the drive in my iBook.  For now though, I'm using iTunes. =(</p>
<p>My sister apparently has grown to hate my cat, Zelda, since I moved out.  She told me she was going to give her up to the <a href="http://www.hsus.org">Humane Society</a> if I didn't come pick her up.  So I eventually did and brought her to Allison's one afternoon to see if she could manage here.  She immediately pissed off our most docile cat, Flea, who proceeded to hunt and attack her for a few hours.  I hoped they'd get over each other, and left them alone.  About 1:30 am later that night we heard cats fighting outside of my room.  We ran outside to try to break them up, but couldn't find them.  Then we heard hissing from the roof.  The cats were on the spine of the roof hissing at each other, and of course I got to get on the roof and take one of them off.  After five minutes or so of trying to mellow them out Flea eventually let me take him down.  Since then though I haven't noticed them fighting. =)</p>
