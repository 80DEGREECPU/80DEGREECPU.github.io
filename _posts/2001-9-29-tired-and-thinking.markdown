title: tired and thinking
---
I went skating today.  I've actually skated twice in one week, I used to skate
<B>*ALL*</B> the time, but in the past two years never really felt like it.  I had a blast
and might start skating more again, but I dunno.   When I've had the free time lately I've
been working on a keybinding/menu/mime-type editor for e17, it's coming along nicely, I
just haven't felt like coding with school keeping me so busy.  Still no sign of my ibook,
Apple says that they're waiting on my combo drive to come in stock so they can replace
it, for a week and a half they've said it shouldn't take more then 2 more days.  I ran
across a weird poem the other day by D.H. Lawrence called Self Pity.<BR><BR>I never 
saw a
wild thing<BR>Sorry for itself.<BR>a small bird with drop frozen dead<BR>From a
bough<BR>Without ever having felt sorry for itself.<BR><BR>  I am not even gonna 
begin to
describe what I think about it, but it did make me think, which I thought was pretty cool.
