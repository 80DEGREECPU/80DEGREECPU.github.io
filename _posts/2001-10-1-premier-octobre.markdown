title: Premier Octobre
---
The first of october means it's <a 
HREF="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Puckett's</a> birthday, happy birthday 
dude.  I'm a lamer and won't go drinking with him at Melange, but I've got an English 
paper to tackle and mid-term to go along with that.  I just found out one of my high 
school friends is interning at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">ms</a> working 
on Outlook, I think that's pretty cool and I'm happy for him.  I also have someone to 
hold accountable next time my dad forwards me a virus without him even knowing =). 
 I want one of <a href="http://www.spireusa.com/index.htm">these</a>, a nice 
backpack for my ibook, if I ever get it back from apple....
