title: When the Music's Over
---
<p>Ho Hum last year was dumb.  Now we're all blessed with a new year to do new things.  The weeks since I graduated have been filled with more awkward and uncomfortable moments than I can count.  I've been reading a quite interesting book, suggested by my friend Jeff(the same guy I kicked a hay bail into a fire at his house), called The Divine Proportion by this guy H.E. Huntley.  Only about a quarter of the way through it, but a book highlighting the beauty of math is definitely cool.  I redid my site, I got sick of the old design, the new design is uglier, but should be lighter on bandwidth.  There's another turd with webspace here.  Say hello to <a href="/~digitalfallout/">df</a>.</p>
