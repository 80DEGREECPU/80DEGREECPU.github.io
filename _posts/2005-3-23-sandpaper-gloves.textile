The last week has been a whirlwind of shit to do.  Work is draining the life out of me, <em>BUT</em> there's been really good music coming through town. :D  <a href="http://www.sagefrancis.net">Sage Francis</a> came through last friday, and <a href="http://www.rhymesayers.com">Atmosphere</a> is playing tonight.  In the process of picking up tickets for the shows I found a <a href="http://www.criminal.com">badass little record store</a> in the artsy part of town.  Looks like I can actually go pick up new albums instead of being forced to order them online.  Definitely looking forward to the long weekend, and MAYBE I'll get to hack on entice some. :)
