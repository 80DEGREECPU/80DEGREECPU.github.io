title: PHP is pretty cool
---
I learned <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> over the past few days, and now it's driving this webpage.  I found it to be <B>Really</B> useful because you can script a lot of the overhead with your site and multiple html files.  The Supreme Facist has something against Niekze getting Sam Adams Pale Ale, two days straight bad luck has left us drinking bad beer.  I've been ripping cds for close to 9 hours now and I'm pretty sick of it.  I finally used <a href="http://validator.w3.org">this</a> to check my site out, and discovered a bunch of things I had overlooked.  Break has been really fun so far, it's a shame school starts in 9 days....
