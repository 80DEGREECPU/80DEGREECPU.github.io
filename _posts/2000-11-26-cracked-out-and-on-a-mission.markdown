title: Cracked Out and On a Mission
---
Everyone should be cracked out and on a mission.  Just find something you wanna do, get all excited about it, and do it.  Thanksgiving break has been pretty fun.  I got to play with my new Sparc10 and it's almost ready to become my NAT box to run this webserver.  I got crazy drunk on Beale street last night and chatted with a hooker(Nothing happened) while I waited for my friend(the designated driver) to get up off the street, and out of his vomit he was lying in.  Got to toy with my web page a little, looked at my next CS project, I've got some issues on how to go about things but should be fine.
