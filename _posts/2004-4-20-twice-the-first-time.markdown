title: Twice The First Time

<p>So <a href="http://aje.codewordt.co.uk/">HandyAnde</a> moved this application called engage into cvs recently.  I've had a bit of fun with it, you can take a look at this <a href="http://zorro.cs.memphis.edu/~cdonohoe/engage.mpeg">movie</a>.    Work is still cool, everything is starting to come together in understanding the components.  Maybe it's time I read the copy of <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201835959/104-4341332-9353569?v=glance">The Mythical Man Month</a> that's been sitting on my bookshelf.</p>
