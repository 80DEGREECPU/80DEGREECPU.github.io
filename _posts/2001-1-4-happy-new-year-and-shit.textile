title: Happy new Year and Shit
---
I've been busy doing nothing lately, so I haven't really done anything on the page.  It snowed in Memphis, which was nice, and it actually stayed on the ground for about two days.  I got kind of nocturnal for a while, and I'm trying to get back on a normal sleep schedule again.  If you didn't know <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/cliff/ihateyou/">Cliff Yablonski</a> hates you, he does.  <a href="/files/myclock-v0.04.tar.gz">myclock-v0.04</a> is available, you can now quit properly, it eats less CPU/Memory you move it around, it's still far from efficient, but it works a lot better.
