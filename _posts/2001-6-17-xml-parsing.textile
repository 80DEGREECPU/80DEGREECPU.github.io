title: xml parsing
---
The past two weeks have been kind of crazy, between school, getting my ibook 
setup and this xml parsing crap <B>I'm tired</B>.  My brain is tired of 
thinking, I'm tired of looking at the computer, and I'm tired of my kitten 
thinking my leg is a scratching post.  French mid-term is in the morning and I 
studied for a bit this evening, who knows how that'll go.  The only cool this 
is I've gotten to do this parsing in C, the more I use C the more I like it 
which is kinda cool.  I saw swordfish last night, it was ok, but was pretty 
cheesy.  <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net">Cozmo85</a> asked the guy selling us 
sodas if he got a discount for hacking the gibson, little did we know this kid 
would not shut up.  He proceeded to tell us about all the crazy shit he's ever 
found on the internet and every stupid story correlating to it.  I wish I had 
a camera because I would gladly submit that kid's photo to <a
