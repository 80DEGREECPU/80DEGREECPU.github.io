<p>With the whole 5 days of free time I've had I've been rather busy.  I upgraded my iBook to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Jaguar</a> and started playing with Mac OS again.  Performance-wise it beats the shit outta the way 10.1 ran on my system.  I've been using <a href="http://darkrock.co.uk/projects/crikey">Crikey</a> to irc from it, and it's been rather nice.  I played some with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/projectbuilder">Project Builder</a>, and wrote a little Java swing application.  For the record, I don't like swing that much.  Project Builder on the other hand has some nice features that I really could get used to having.  I'm loving my freedom.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlamp.com">ONLamp</a> has a cool article up entitled <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/05/12/languagephilosophy.html">What I Hate About Your Programming Language</a>, it's an interesting read if you've ever bitched about language X or Y.  There was also a nested link in there about <a href="http://www.home.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6701">Buffer Overflows</a> which seemed worth sharing.</p>
<p>Congrats to <a href="http://speedstar.xcomputerman.com">JeopardE</a> for graduating, hopefully he'll find a job and get to stay in the US.</p>
