<p><a href="http://www.eng.morgan.edu/~cjt/poetry/revol.html">"The revolution will not be televised"</a><BR><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>-- Gil Scott-Heron</DIV></p><p>  I need to renew my domain, I have like 2 weeks or something or I lose it.  Gotta remember to do that...  I had a weird ass valentines days, but prolly not as weird as <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">niece whore</a>.  Helped my friend Erik move into a new apartment last weekend too.  I hacked up ebony in CVS to use the new ebg stuff.  I've made a couple backgrounds I have sitting around now, eventually I'll put em <a href="/bgs">here</a>.
