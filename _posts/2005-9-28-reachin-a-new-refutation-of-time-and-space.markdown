title: Reachin a New Refutation of Time And Space
---
I've technically been engaged for 364 days now, and I've managed to dodge the question of "have you set a date yet?" thusfar.  I'm not really excited about the idea of getting married(as I probably should be), but I'm more into the idea of keeping Allison around.  I'm sure one of these days we'll have a little celebration where we legally tie the knot, but for now neither of us are really pressuring the other into making it priority #1.  I'm glad she's toughed it out with me.

Totally unrelated to my anniversary is some contract work I've picked up.  It's some rails work in the off hours of my regular job, and it's gonna be a nice challenge.  This is putting other things on hold for now, but I'm anxious to get some 'real world' experience hacking on a rails project.
