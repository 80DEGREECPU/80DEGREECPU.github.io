title: Bleh, Pheh, among other things

<a href="http://pablotron.org/projects/pheh/">Pheh</a> is something Pabs from #e
is writing which is an <a href="http://linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/">Feh</a> clone using
evas, it seems to stay at 100% cpu usage when I'm running it.  Allen and I
talked about possibly writing our own clone of feh using evas, but I'm not sure
if it'd be worth it at this point.  My CS class is moving at a frighteningly
slow pace in the lectures, whoever all this review is for is obviously screwed
on the first assignment which is due next week I think.  Search for "dumb
motherfucker" on google, or click <a
