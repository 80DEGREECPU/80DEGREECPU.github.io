title: Caffeine and Nicotine
---
I am a caffeine and nicotine based lifeform right now.  Sleep is a friend I dearly miss.  It's only like 3am, but today has been <B>VERY</B> long.  I'm on the conclusion to my philosophy paper which is due in a few hours.  I got all my database stuff done for the other day.  Programs handed in in my CS class.  Math quizzes taken.  I think I am currently sitting on 1 day to relax before I have a plethora of shit to do again. Thanks to <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Niekze</a> I can now receive email at this domain, which is a big bonus. Gotta get back to work on the paper, but I should have some new things this weekend for the site as I plan to devote some time to it. Peace.
