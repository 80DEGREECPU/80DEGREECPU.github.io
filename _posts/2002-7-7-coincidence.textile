Look at the cover of the <a href="/images/dj_shadow_the_private_press.jpg">new dj shadow album</a> and then look at the cover to <a href="/images/vi6.gif">Learning the vi Editor</a>.  Whatever kinda animal that is it sure looks the exact same.  I'm going to the beach for 11 days with my family and my dog.
