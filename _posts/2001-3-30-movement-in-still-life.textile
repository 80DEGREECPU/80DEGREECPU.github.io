title: Movement in Still Life
---
I moved to a new house this week.  It's about 5 minutes from school which makes it much easier to get to school on time, and cuts about an hour and a half of driving outta my day than living with my parents.  Other than no internet, no Bridie =( and little things that aren't setup around the house the move went rather smoothly.  Should have DSL in about 4 weeks, so I'm gonna get cable till that pans out.  Site layout took a big switch.  I'm trying to move away the square news update site, and give it a cleaner layout by abusing php-imlib. Note: I'm updating my page even though I have no internet and no one will see this for 6 days hah.
