title: Grabbed A Xbox
---
So I picked up a used Xbox in hopes of throwing "gentoox":http://gentoox.shallax.com/index.php on it.  It's gonna be a few days until I really get to tinker with it, but I'm hoping it'll turn out to be a cool asset to my home. At this point in time it looks like I'm going to try "Software Flashing":http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Software_Method_HOWTO as I lucked out and have an older "mod friendly" xbox. I do however have a tendency to jump into things, break them and then try to fix them.  I'm hoping I don't flash something incorrectly and brick it.  :)

"Exhibits":http://svn.xenith.org/projects/exhibits made some progress last week.  Check it out and bitch about it, k, thx bye.
