title: evas is tight
---
E17 got directory displays last week, so I hacked in <a href="http://www.linuxbrit.co.uk">feh</a> support =).  I've also been coding with <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/evas.html">Evas</a> a lot lately.  I developed a cheesy version of the mac os x doc for e17, it's not done yet though.      There is a screenshot of it <a href="/misc/index.php?im=edock.png">here</a> and <a href="/sshots/index.php?im=atmos-07-16-2001.png">here</a>.  I was hacking it directly into the background of E but it became obvious it needed more space.  Evas is extremely fun to make shit with and it's pretty easy to learn.  Watch <a href="/flash/russian_crab_movie_shortened_wav.swf">Scared Boy</a> it's really unique.
