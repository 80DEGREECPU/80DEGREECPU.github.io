title: When it breaks it'll all come together...
---
<p>It was ok when my desktop died, I accepted it.  I had a backup, my Vaio.  Now my Vaio is dead, or atleast mostly dead.  Earlier this evening it froze, it'd never frozen before.  It's doing weird shit, like after it'll freeze  it won't display anything if I immediately reboot it, but if I give it a few minutes of downtime it'll boot and then freeze after a few more minutes.  I'm gonna go see what my warranty is worth tomorrow, I'm hoping they'll just replace it.  The shitty thing is I backed up a ton of data to my laptop from my desktop's hard drive, I have no idea if I'll be able to get it back.  So what computers am I down to?(I whine like  I have nothing)  My webserver or my iBook, I went with the iBook.  I spent a few hours messing with a very outdated <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> potato cd, it won't install.  <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> freezes when it tries to boot the kernel.  So I'm giving <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> a try.  If it really comes down to it I'll compile my e libs on my webserver and run them remotely, the machine's much faster anyways.</p>
