The header is a quote from a Last Emporer track, you do the math.  Got tipped off to a hilarious Windows Whistler <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/WHISTLARWINDOWS2010/index.htm">review</a>, and to <a href="http://web2.airmail.net/gandolf/you.htm">some guy</a> who needs your help.  It's 6am, and I'm going to sleep
