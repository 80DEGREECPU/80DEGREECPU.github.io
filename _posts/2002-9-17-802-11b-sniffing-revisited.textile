title: 802.11b sniffing revisited
---
<p>I went to upgrade my <a href="http://www.kernel.org">kernel</a> today so
I checked out the <a
HREF="http://airsnort.shmoo.com/orinocoinfo.html">orinoco patch page</a> and
found that <a href="http://www.swieskowski.net/code/wifi.php">someone </a>
had fixed the firmware issues with airport cards with a software hack. So I
shook my ass, and I patched my kernel, and voila! my ibook sniffs properly
now. I had a <a href="http://www.remote-exploit.org">Wellenreiter</a> how-to
a month or so ago, but it was useless cause of the firmware things, I've put
it online <a href="/files/ibook_sniffing.txt">here</a>.</p>
