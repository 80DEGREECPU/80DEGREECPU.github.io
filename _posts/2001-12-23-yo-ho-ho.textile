Christmas break is a gift, I needed this downtime.  I think I have finally 
gotten my email moved over to an IMAP server hooray for consistent email 
anywhere. =)  It actually turned out to be a nice combination of <a href=
"http://www.qmail.org">Qmail</a>, <a href="http://www.inter7.com/
vpopmail/">vpopmail</a>, <a href="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/
">Courier-IMAP</a> handling everything imap/pop3/authentication/
roaming smtp, and virtual users/domains.  It's been kind of a pain in the 
ass setting it up, but now that it's actually working with procmail and all my 
email accounts are consolidated I'm pretty happy with it.  I got these <a

the flying saucer last week for their christmas pint glass wednesday thing.    
Today is my mom's birthday, happy birthday.  Also a happy birthday to <a

two days left.  Merry Christmas and happy new year and all that shit.
