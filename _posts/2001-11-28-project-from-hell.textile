title: Project from hell
---
I've grown so tired of my project for my software development class it's pathetic.  
While it has a really cool OO design, the implementation has been rushed due to 
time constraints(end of the semester).  It really sucks when you put hard time and 
thought into something and you have to rush it.  I guess that's the point of this class, 
in the real world you're rushed, and writing software with a strict specification to meet 
a client's needs is fucking hard.  It makes me much more fond of open-source/free 
software with no deadlines, you have the time to work out what you want, you can 
test it accordingly, and in the end you have a quality product that is available to 
everyone(it's a shame jobs like this are few and far between).  It'd be nice to see 
more design ahead of time in free/open source software, but perhaps that's part of 
the fun, build and fix and have fun doing it. =)  On top of finishing this project I have 
to write a 7 page paper for english(due monday also), implement vfork() in the minix 
kernel, and do a bunch of book work(due tuesday, today is tuesday of the preceding 
week btw).  Wireless nfs is the shit.
