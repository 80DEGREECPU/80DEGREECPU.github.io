title: what the fuck?
---
Today was by far the most fucked up day in quite some time.  Two planes crashed into 
the twin towers in NYC, and the twin towers are no more.  a plane crashed into the 
pentagon, and one crashed in Pennsylvania somewhere. I woke up at like 1pm and 
noticed I had email in my school mailbox.  I opened it up and it was an email from the 
president of my university telling us we still have classes and their hearts go out to all 
those affected by the terrorist acts.   Extremely confused I checked <a 
HREF="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> and the headline read "America Under Attack" 
and I found out all about what went down today.  I even turned the TV on for most of the 
day which is something I rarely take the time to watch. I was really freaked out cause my 
dad was in New York the past few days and was flying home this morning so I 
immediately called his cell phone.  He answered and let me know he is fine and is 
drivinig home because he doesn't see himself getting a flight home in the next few days.  
I really don't know what to think about all of 
this but it strikes me as such a blatant disregard for human life and it's kind of saddening. 
 In our day to day thoughts shit like this never comes into play.  We bitch about petty shit 
that doesn't even matter in the big picture yet it seems so meaningful to our self 
indulgent lives.  I wish we never would have to think about stuff like this, but it seems we 
should.  What's even sadder is that in a week I figure 90% of america will be right back 
into their same old routine.
