<p>I feel dirty, I'm currently installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows XP</a> on my laptop :(  I have to work with Windows for my networking project, strangely enough taking advantage of a <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> library that only works under Windows!  So much for portability.  I'm hoping to get <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> running on my iBook, but my first attempts failed miserably.  My iBook shuts down right after it loads the kernel.</p>
<p>School is life right now.   Ben got me a book for my birthday, looks quite neat.  Been fleshing out code to incorporate epeg into ethumb, that's coming along in the little free time I have.</p>
