title: Not a Normal Tuesday
---
<p>Memphis got hit by some crazy ass weather the other morning(100 mph+ gusts).  We get tornados and thunderstorms quite often, but the other morning we didn't have any warning or anything.  Two days later 50% of the traffic lights around town are still functioning as four way stops, and something like more than 200,000 homes/businesses are without power.  My friend Sydney lost his car and had to move cause a tree fell through his house.  Allison has been pissed cause she keeps having to go to work even though there is no power and she can't help people.  Basically mother nature came and kicked Memphis's ass Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to clean up a new default theme for entrance, but I'm also trying to make sure school and Allison are getting proper attention.  My webserver was down last week due to a power outage and then my decision to do some system maintenance.  Anyways things are good, which is nice to be able to say. =)</p>
