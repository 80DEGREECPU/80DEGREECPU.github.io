Let's see, I'm not super busy right now, but I wanna get this CS project outta the way.  I met this kid <a href="http://darius.dynodns.net">Darius</a> who got me onto the idea of perl and sql, we had an idea about a clock thing, but I have to hold off until Christmas break from school before I could sit down to learn C and then Imlib2 which is what I think we're gonna use for it.  <B>Big Ups</B> to <a href="http://www.mobindustries.net">mobrep</a> for finally getting his GED, took ya long enough.  <a href="/images/geogarmy.jpg">This</a> is for anyone who's ever been lost before.  I'm goin back to my pathetic attempts at coding.
