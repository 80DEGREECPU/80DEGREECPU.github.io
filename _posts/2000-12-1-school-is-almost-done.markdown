title: School is almost done
---
"It's as good as it gets, or as bad as you make it." Just a little quote I heard today in a song.  I have one week till exams start.  Then a nice month off for Christmas break.  This weekend will entail getting my CS project done.  I've got the core of the problem solved just one more thing to implement and I'm done.  If I get it done before sometime tommorow night I may toy with the design of the page, but for now I'm content with it.  <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD 2.8</a> has been officially released even though it's been on the ftps since late wednesday night.  If you don't know what OpenBSD is, it's a great BSD distribution it's free, well organized, runs on a bunch of architectures, is secure on the install, and runs great provided it's not your desktop machine.  That's it for now, I'll have updates this weekend.
