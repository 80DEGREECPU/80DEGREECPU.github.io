title: gin n' tonic
---
Gin n' tonic is good. =)  I've found myself unbelieveably bored lately.  I don't actually 
browse the web that much anymore, I just look at friend's sites, check out web shit at <a 
HREF="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">k5</a>, 
and occasionally <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com">SomethingAwful</a>.  I 
have tons of schoolwork I could be doing, programming stuff I'm actually interested in, or 
doing social things, but for some reason I don't feel like doing a damn thing.  Wonder 
when I'll be hit with some motivation.  My english class is turning out to be dope so far, 
we just read a lot of poems and write up short critiques of them, most of the readings 
have been cool which makes the work not seem so cumbersome.  Operating systems 
and Software Engineering classes are both dope, <B>LOTS</B> of reading though.  My 
cat has finally gotten her stitches out and is back to being a little hellian, hopefully I'll 
never have to see her vital organs again.  The weather in Memphis is becoming quite 
pleasant which is a major bonus.  I supposidly have a job now too, I'm gonna be assisting 
with the administration of the cs department unix network which should be really cool.  
They're still trying to figure out how to pay me cause I'm an undergrad and it's normally a 
graduate student position, so needless to say I haven't started yet.  ...
