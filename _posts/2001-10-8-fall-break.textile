title: fall break

I'm on fall break, and so far I've enjoyed the first three of my five day weekend.  I 
wrote a little keybind editor for e17 you can grab it <a 
HREF="/files/ebinds-0.01.tar.gz">here</a>.  The first respone I got for it however 
was a backtrace, and I knew what was wrong, but I have no clue why it happened 
to the guy.  The menu editor I wrote is done too but badly needs a facelift.  I'll 
probably end up combining the two with mime file association and a few other things 
to make a one stop tool to configuring basic stuff in e.  Apple has actually promised 
me hardware for keeping my ibook for so long, can you say "Airport" =)  Oh yeah! 
We bombed afghanistan yesterday, dunno what to think about that.  I guess I'll just 
hope I don't have to go war because honestly I don't want to. =(
