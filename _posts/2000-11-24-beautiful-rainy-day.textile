title: Beautiful Rainy Day
---
It rained today, and this being a holiday I got to sit around and goof off all day.  Someone showed me <a href="/images/one-big-lanparty.jpg">this</a> last night, and well, that's a shitload of people.  I added the Old News section to the web because I plan on continuing to update things, and this page will only show the 8 most recent things I added.  Old News will keep everything available and it's done from the database too, so that is the first page I didn't put an ounce of effort into the actual html.  I've been getting my sparc ready to become my webserver, but I'm not completely sure I'll be able to get everything working off the bat so that may have to wait.  I'm prolly gonna kick it the rest of the weekend and code an upcoming project for my CS class. Peace.
