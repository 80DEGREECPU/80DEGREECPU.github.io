Allison has tons of photo albums.  If you're willing she will sit down and show you all sorts of photos, describing the background story associated with each one.  Days before I'd watched her take photos of photos, something that struck me as abosolutely hilarious.  I ended up hopping on "craigslist":http://atlanta.craigslist.com to see if I could find a her a scanner locally for a sane price.  Found some dude with a brand new "Epson CX4200":http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&oid=56291068 for about half the retail price.  She's slowly going through photo albums and scanning the photos.  She's becoming so digital, she's even talking about storing all of the photos somewhere else once they're all digitized.  Less clutter she says.  This is by far my favorite scan, my brother Devin found this photo when he was visiting around New Years.  It's been on our fridge since, but I couldn't help but share it.
