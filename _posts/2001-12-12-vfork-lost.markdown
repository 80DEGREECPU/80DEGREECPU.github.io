title: vfork() lost
---
So vfork() was knocked out in the 12th round(hour).  <B>AND</B> I got two finals outta the way today, and only have one left(HOORAY!).  <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net/">Coz</a> pointed me towards <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1991Oct5.054106.4647%40klaava.Helsinki.FI">this</a> yesterday, it's Linus's original usenet post anouncing his new <a href="http://www.linux.org">os</a>.  I found quake for os x the other day and I've been playing that here and there.  a lot of people seemed really surprised that I had never played it before, anyways it's pretty fun.  <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Niekze</a> hooked me up with a dell p2-233 so I could setup a fileserver, and I think he eventually wants to move his web stuff to be hosted here, and for a decent extra box I wouldn't mind, especially since our websites have about 12 visitors annually. =)
