title: I learned PERL, sorta
---

I sat down earlier this evening with a book, and started playing with <a href="http://www.perl.com">Perl</a> and with my limited knowledge of <a href="http://www.pgsql.com">PgSQL</a>.  I ended up with the dynamic webpage thing I wanted.  It's referencing a database now and creates the updates, you're reading now, automatically for me. It's much nicer than having to edit an index.html file everytime I wanna add a link or something.  The windows on my screen are starting to move because I'm still kinda fucked up from not sleeping earlier this week.  Tommorow however is a holiday.  I'd like to take this time to wish everbody a nice Thanksgiving, and well, that's it.  I need to sleep.  You might wanna check <a href="/images/daemon_1.jpg">this</a> out though, it's a BSD daemon made from legos, I got a kick outta it.
