title: I can has ... wolf dog?
---
After getting [denali][denaliset]
around Christmas time last year, I really hadn't planned on getting another dog
for a while.  Then I came back to Memphis and met a friend's 
[wolf hybrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_hybrid).  He was a big beautiful four
year old dog and I found myself really wanting one.  I'm terribly impulsive
when it comes to things like this.  If I *really* *really* want something, I
usually figure out how to get it.  So I scoured the local papers and found a
breeder with 7 week old pups, one of which was a beautiful blue eyed little
girl cub.  This was a few days before [Railsconf](http://railsconf.org) so I
figured I'd read up on them some more and make my final decision when I
returned.  At railsconf I ended up talking a handful of people's ears off about
how beautiful and wonderful these wolf dogs were.  I think everyone thought I
was a little crazy when I'd describe my desire to have a wolf.  I even had an
[Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com) client tell me "You look like the kinda
person who would own a wolf."  I don't really know if that's a complement or
what...

So this is my new wolf dog .  She's 7/8ths Arctic and Timber wolf and 1/8th
Husky, so she's technically a 'high content' wolf dog.

*EVERYONE* seems to have an opinion on this.  If only I had a dollar for every
genius who told me "you just gotta be the alpha..."  Animal behavior,
especially psuedo-wild animals, is actually a hell of a lot more complicated
than just being 'the alpha.'  So I've been reading a bunch to expose myself to
possible warning signs of behavioral problems and hopefully make the years to
come really easy for our pack. :)

The silly thing is that I really didn't find the resources that were most
informative until after I'd had Cindy for a week or two.  If you or anyone you
know is ever considering getting a wolf hybrid check out Nicole Wilde's
[Living with Wolfdogs][livingwith], it's extremely informative.  If I'd read
that book before I got Cindy, I might not have gotten such a high content wolf
dog.  I am a little weary of what she'll be like from about 10 months to 2
years, a lot of the 'wolfy' behavior seems to come out  when they hit sexual
maturity.  Specifically I'm scared about a Cindy/Denali alpha bitch clash at
some point, I really should have gotten a male.  I also pretty much committed
myself to living in houses with 6 foot tall fences for the next 10-15 years,
apartments just won't cut it.  There are just all of these little things you
have to keep an eye out for because, well, they're not dogs. :(

Anyway, she's a simply wonderful little pup.  I'm doing daily [clicker
training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clicker_training) with her and
Denali(separately of course).  She's got three labs to play with and a big back
yard.  She also gets to play with Hubble and Kioko practically every day.  I
really doubt socialization will be an issue with her.  Her flickr set will grow
in time, but probably not as quickly as she's growing.  She's 13 weeks now, and
I give her another 6-8 weeks before she's bigger than Denali.  I'm definitely
have a shitload of fun with the dogs right now. :)
