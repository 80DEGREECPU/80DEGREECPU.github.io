title: 2 Years of Uselessness
---
<p>My website is two years old today, which is scary.  It's kinda interesting to look back that far though.  I'm sick on my birthday which makes it all that much better.  It's raining, and I've been goofing off this afternoon in front of my computer.  I'm 23 today which means I'm getting on in my years.  I feel old.
