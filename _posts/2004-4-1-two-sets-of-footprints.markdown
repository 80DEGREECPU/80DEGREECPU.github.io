title: Two Sets of Footprints
---
<p>I started my new job today, it's with the <a href="http://issrl.cs.memphis.edu">Intelligent Security Systems Research Laboratory</a>.  I plan on helping introduce that site to XHTML/CSS, right now it's not the most appealing.  Paperwork is done, I have keys to both labs, and I have a PC.  I'm missing a dvi to vga converter on the machine, but it supports <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">nvidia</a> twinview.  The development machines are dreamy, pentium4 @ 2.4ghz(w/ hyperthreading), a gig of ram, 120GB SATA drives, and an nvidia quadro.  They're even running <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> :).  I can't wait to see its evas bench.  I saw a lot of friendly faces around campus, I'm glad I won't be in Dunn Hall all the time.  The lab is in a brand new building at the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu">U of M</a>, it's the FedEx Institute of Technology.  Hopefully I'll post some pictures in the weeks to come, you would probably want to work here.</p>
<p>No real E coding done the past few days.  The file dialog is checked into esmart, but other than a few minor things that's about it.  Since my new job isn't actually full time I'll actually have free time during the week.  I plan on using this free time to work on E and look into graduate school.  Thanks to Mike Frysinger for the Sparc Tadpole2.  I'm hoping to get some modern free unix on it shortly, it came with some old version of SunOS.</p>
