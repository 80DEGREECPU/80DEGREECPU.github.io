title: ibook + school = busy
---
I've decided not to put linux on my ibook, atleast not for now.  I figured "Why
buy a mac to run linux on ? Use Mac OS for what it's good for." and linux
currently doesn't support sound on my ibook.  So I looked into other options and
discovered <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/">XonX</a> which allows
XFree86 to run on Darwin-PPC.  X and OS X Aqua can work together like <a
HREF="http://www.mit.edu/~rueckert/XFreeAqua.jpg">this</a> and <a
HREF="http://www.mit.edu/~rueckert/XFreeAqua2.jpg">this</a>.  So I set that up
with blackbox and it's kinda neat.  School has been surprisingly overwhelming,
as I have a test friday and monday, plus a mid-term already the following
monday.  I haven't taken any pictures of my kitten yet, but I prolly will
shortly.  That's it...
