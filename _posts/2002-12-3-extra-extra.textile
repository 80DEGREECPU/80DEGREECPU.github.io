<p>Papers.  The end of the semester brings with it due dates for papers.  I have three 5-7 page papers due in the next 36 hours.  One of which is almost done.  The crappy thing is they're research papers which require you to filter out all sorts of crap in order to find decent references.  This creates problems under time constraints, but I tend to work better under them anyways.</p>
<p><B>I found my ipod</B>.  I repeat. <B>I found my ipod</B>.  It was a happy day a few days back when I found my ipod in a box in my attic after it went awol two months ago.  I'm anxiously awaiting some free time so I can mess with <a href="http://www.blinkenlights.ch/cgi-bin/fm.pl?get=ipode">GNUpod</a>.  Ideally I'd like an xmms plugin that'll let me dump playlists to my ipod.  Might make a decent Christmas break project...</p>
<p>Thanksgiving was interesting, went to the Weinbergs with my family, and Allison's parents with her.  I haven't moved much of my stuff from Alice's house to Allison's yet.  My computers are there, just not plugged in yet.  My room is cool and spacious, but getting situated there has taken a backseat to finishing papers.   While packing up my stuff Alice and I stared at these Gin bottles that had been on top of one of my bookshelves for about a year, <a href="http://www.nothingkillsfaster.com">Puckett</a> and I drank most of them.  She pointed at them and said "That was a phase" but ever so subtly hinting at the point that me living with her was a phase too.  My sister is a cool chick.</p>
