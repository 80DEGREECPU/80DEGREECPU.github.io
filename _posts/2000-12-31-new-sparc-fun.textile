title: New Sparc Fun!
---
We finally got the Sparc Classic's we won on Ebay for 20$ last month.  All of the eprom's came admin passwords.  <a href="http://nothingkillsfaster.com">Niekze</a> found some crazy idea about booting off a known good eprom, hotswapping your adminned one and resetting the security settings and it actually worked.  Atmos.org is now being hosted on this little machine, it's name is <a href="/pics/frodo.jpg">Frodo</a>.  I spent prolly 8 and a half hours trying different configs, only to be faced with more errors thanks to the quality 200MB drive it came with.  I ended up putting a nice 1 gig drive in and didn't run into any more problems.  So I'm back up and running. Only bad part is I lost my ip, so not atmos.org for a few days until it updates.  Thanks <a href="http://www.granitecanyon.com">Granite Canyon</a> you slow ass piece of shit!  I am now going to sleep because it's New Year's Eve and there is much beer to be consumed this evening.
