atmos.org was a little project for me I guess.  I started maintaining it somewhat consistenly in November of 2000.  This site is a journal of sorts for things I&#8217;m working on or happenings in my life.  It&#8217;s done with "Mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/, "Mephisto":http://www.mephistoblog.com/, "MySQL":http://www.mysql.com and "TextMate":http://www.macromates.com.

My name is Corey Donohoe.  I&#8217;m 27 years old and live in Longmont, CO.  I work as a ruby programmer/sysadmin for a "cool company":http://www.engineyard.com.  Things consuming my free time include good music, "ruby":http://ruby-lang.org, *NIX, disc golf, rock climbing, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atmos/">photography</a> and my badass mutts "Denali":http://flickr.com/photos/atmos/sets/72157594425531384/ and "Cinderella":http://flickr.com/photos/atmos/sets/72157600253032345/.
