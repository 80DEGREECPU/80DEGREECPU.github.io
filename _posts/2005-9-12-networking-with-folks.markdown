"court3nay":http://habtm.com et al have been hacking on a "mint":http://www.haveamint.com/ replacement for rails apps.  It's quite cool for about 72 hours of work.  It's still got a long way to go, but keep an eye out for "weed":http://weed.rbse.com as there's a pretty talented group of folks hacking like madmen on it right now.

Also I've talked to a few people on freenode and on the typo mailing list about joining forces to formalize my "exhibits":http://www.atmos.org/exhibits/.  Hopefully we can drag some one in with a better eye for presentation and solidify the backend.  It'll like be extracted into a standalone app(prolly called exhibits), but I hope to keep a "typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com overlay available for keeping it simple to integrate with your blog.
