title: 372 Days and Running !

I had a birthday, I'm 22 now.  My birthday kinda hallmarks a year of me maintaining 
this website.  While it's gotten lots of facelifts and stuff over the year, I've grown quite 
fond of the simple design it's become.  It's kinda funny for me to look back over the 
entries and remember what was going on when I added them.  I was lucky enough to 
get a nice <a 
HREF="http://www.spireusa.com/products/mac/icon/icon.htm">backpack</a> for my 
birthday, so for now my laptop is safe.  I saw <a 
HREF="http://www.alternativetentacles.com/">Jello Biafra</a> do a spoken word 
thing the other day, it was really really cool to say the least.  The <a 
HREF="http://www.acm.org">acm</a> sent our school a bunch of mac development 
shit the other day, and I was lucky enough to get one of the care packages which 
contained a full version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">os x.1</a> 
instead of the upgrade I previously had.  I've been working on a data structures 
library in C recently which has been really fun so far, dunno if/or when I'll release it, 
but it has quite a few more things on the TODO list before I'd consider giving it to 
anyone.  I <B>NEED</B> to fix the font size for the date in my headers, it's not even 
legible. =(
