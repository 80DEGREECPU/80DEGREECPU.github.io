I managed to scrounge together a wireless network at home this 
weekend.  I got a linksys wap 11 and an airport card which (after getting a 
windows box to configure) seems to be working great with my ibook(even 
in linux ).  After having it for two days it makes me wonder how I ever got by 
without it(Now all I need is a battery in my ibook that lasts more then 4 
hours and sound in linux).  OS X has this wonderful built in feature for 
network configuration, so I can just tell it I'm at home, and it configures my 
network for being at home, or my parent's house if I'm at theirs.  This isn't 
really anything that couldn't be accomplised by a shell script or two, but it 
makes it really convenient none the less. <B>LOTS</B> of relatives have 
been visiting for the holidays, and even my niece <a href="/images/
