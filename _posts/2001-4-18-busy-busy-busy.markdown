School is killing me.  I've been doing nothing, but school work and it's 
starting to get annoying. The semester ends one week from today so there is 
TONS of shit pending.  Physics test tommorow morning and I have barely skimmed 
the material.  The most tedious assembly assignment ever was finally handed in 
so atleast that's not on my mind.  Before all the craziness started again I 
began playing with evas and made a little evas movie and redid that clock idea 
from last year.  I wanna hack myclock into the root evas of e17 and just sort 
of have the time displayed on my desktop.  I'll have to dig through e17 to do 
that and I have no clue when I'll have the free time.
