title: How Soon Is Now?
---
<p>I got a digital camera.  It's a <a href="http://www.canoneos.com/digitalrebel/index.html">Canon EOS Digital Rebel</a>, mmmmm SLR.  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com">BestBuy</a> has this credit card you can apply for where you get zero percent interest and allows you to pay off your purchase incrementally.  <em>MY GIRLFRIEND IS AWESOME.</em>  Allison got the credit card(they turned me down for having no credit), and I'm paying it off in monthly installments.  Hopefully this will help me build atleast a little credit.  I've found <a href="http://www.photoworkshop.com/canon/index.html">online tutorials</a> specifically for the cool features of my rebel, and it works <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/USB-Digital-Camera-HOWTO.html">perfectly in Linux</a>.  I debated using <a href="http://www.gphoto.org">libgphoto</a> to interface with <a href="/docs/entice/index.html">entice</a>, but it'd require a license change.  I'm still kinda tempted.</p>
<p>I was very hesitant to mention the fact that I've quit smoking recently.  I've mentioned it once or twice before in my weblog, and always ended up smoking again. After years and years of smoking cigarettes, I've finally quit.  It's been about two months now, and I'm hoping to never look back.  I did it with the help of <a href="http://nicodermcq.quit.com/">the patch</a>.  A friend at work pointed out that the money I'm saving by not smoking will practically pay my monthly installments for my camera.  That and the fact that Allison and I have been exercising together leave me feeling better than I have in a long time.  We've been going to her gym a few times a week, and I even ran into <a href="https://www.linuxlockdown.com/">an old friend</a> there.</p>
<p>Busy week ahead, working extra hours in order to take a few days off next week to coincide with Allison's vacation.  We're going to Nashville to see <a href="http://www.rhymesayers.com">Brother Ali</a> and stay with my friend Erik for a few days.  I'm also interviewing for a new job opportunity, it sounds <em>very</em> interesting.  Have a phone interview tomorrow afternoon, if/when it pans out I'll undoubtedly update and explain.  Atlanta anyone? :)  I almost forgot!  My sister,neice, and brother-in-law are in town this week, spending what time I can with them too.</p>
