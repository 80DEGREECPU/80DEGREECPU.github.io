<p>So I went all xhtml/css wonky and reworked my site.  I have a strange problem in trying to migrate from html to xhtml.  A bunch of my weblog entries are ridden with html tags using upper case letters, not a problem in html4, but it'll cause xhtml to not validate.  I've cleansed what I immediately noticed with some perl, but there's still more and instead of breaking my data, I figure I'll just leave it.</p>
<p>My VAIO is back.  I got so used to not having it around, that i've barely used it since I got it back.  Haven't really done any work on enlightenment stuff in the past two weeks, everything has been web content. :(  I do have a copy of Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice in C on the way, and a few cds by Coldcut thanks to Joe and Midge.</p>
