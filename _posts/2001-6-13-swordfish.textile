My ibook now has <a 
HREF="http://www.suse.com">SuSE</a> PPC on it which means I have an ibook that 
I can code on which is pretty tight.  OS X surprisingly wasn't cutting it for 
me, all I've been using is os9 and linux on it the past few days and I'm 
really happy with the laptop I got, all i need is wireless internet for it.... 
French class is time consuming, and my independent study thing is about to get 
demanding so I figure I'm going to be really busy for a while.  <a

apparently can't install linux and resorts back to the windows routine of 
isolating oneself and playing counter strike for weeks at a time.  Look at <a

you haven't lately as it's been redone.  <a href="/zelda/">My kitten</a> eats 
pens, twist ties, my hands, paper, my ibook, and every wire in the house, 
she's pretty cool though.
