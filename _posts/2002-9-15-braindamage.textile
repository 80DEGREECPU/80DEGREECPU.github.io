<p>I can't concentrate on anything.  I haven't done much homework in the past two weeks other than calculus 2.  I haven't smoked a cigarette in a week.  I want this semester to be over with, and it just started.  Not smoking is taking a lot of getting used to.  In order to avoid homework I messsed with web content and cleaned my room, wasting a wonderful sunday.  Watched some football, I hate how when football season starts it cuts into the Simpsons time.</p>
<p>I've been playing with flex and bison some.  Ebony is all caught up to work with evas2, but aparently ebits2 will make ebony obsolete.  oh well.  I took a <a href="/sshots/atmos-desktop-09_10_2002.jpg">screenshot</a> the other day.  My desktop always looks the same.</p>
