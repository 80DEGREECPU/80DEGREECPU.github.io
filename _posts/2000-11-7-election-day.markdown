title: Election Day
---
I didn't vote today. I'm well, lazy.  I did find <a href="http://www.h2k.net/post/panels/keynote.mp3"> this</a> on <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> the other day.  Jello Biafra has some interesting views on some things.  He seems pretty paranoid and shit, but brings up some interesting stuff.  It's kinda lengthy, but definately worth a listen.
