title: Nautilus Review
---
<a href="http://www.pablotron.org">Pabs</a> from enlightenment put his <a href="http://www.pablotron.org/reviews/nautilus-PR2/">review</a> of Nautilus up.  Which is pretty funny and honest to the kinds of criticisms you'd prolly have if you tried it.  It's definately frightened me away from giving it a try, thought I hadn't really considered it.  Lots of screenshots and stuff so you can see what to expect if you really must try it
