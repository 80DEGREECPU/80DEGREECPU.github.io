title: summertime shit
---
First session of summer is complete which is rad.  Only four more weeks of french until I'm completely finished with my foreign language requirements.  Went to a party last night and drank too much, it was definately cool though, a local band and people I hadn't met or don't get to see very often.  I have been playing with Evas for the past two days and I like it.  I wrote a little truetype font viewer with it that works somewhat to the same fashion as <a href="http://www.linuxbrit.co.uk/feh/">FEH</a>, it's available <a href="/downloads/">here</a>. I've actually wanted something like this for a while so it's pleasant to be able to solve your own problems.  You can see the ttf viewer and my clock thing running under E17 <a href="/sshots/?im=atmos-07-08-2001.png">here</a>.  I can't really think of anything else right now....
