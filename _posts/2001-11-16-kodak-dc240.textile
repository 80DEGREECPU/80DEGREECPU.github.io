title: Kodak DC240
---
I got <a href="http://www.cozmo85.net">Cozmo's</a> old <a 
HREF="http://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc240/">Kodak DC240</a>, 
which he was nice enough to let go for pretty cheap(95$).  I've added a couple new 
pictures of <a href="/zelda/">zelda</a> that I took with it.  The dope thing about 
this cam is that it works with <a href="http://www.gphoto.org">gphoto</a> under 
linux. =)  The next 10 days are gonna be chalk full of code, integration, and finding 
out if really designing a system before-hand ends up making it easier to implement.  
We've actually got a cool design, but the time constraints are gonna make it rough to 
properly test it.  I added a <a 
HREF="/sshots/index.php?im=atmos-11-16-2001.png">screenshot</a> of e17 I took 
the other day, you can see the iconbar on the desktop, and that the desktop is no 
longer monitoring your home directory so it's a lot less crowded.
