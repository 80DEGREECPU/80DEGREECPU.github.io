Next up will be bringing my galleries back.  Hopefully will have a much cooler category approach for them.  I want something similar to "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us and "gmail":http://gmail.google.com tags.  
I've got a friend Will coming into town this weekend and we're hoping to go shoot around Atlanta some.  Main destinations being the "Atlanta Botanical Gardens":http://www.atlantabotanicalgarden.org/ and the Sweetwater Brewing Company.

I got a wonderful case of poison ivy last week climbing.  I'm almost over it with the help of "Zanfel":http://www.zanfel.com.  The stuff works amazing, but it's really pricey(40$ for a 1oz tube).
