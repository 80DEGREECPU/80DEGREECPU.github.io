I'm 21 today. In the US that means I can legally buy and consume alcohol.  I plan on abusing this privelidge for a while.  I've been working on learning shit as I go, so the layout may change from time to time with what I'm learning.  School is killing me right now, it's keeping me busy as hell.  This page is documentation of what I'm doing and learning at the current time.  For the time being please don't bitch about broken links or criticize me cause honestly, I don't care.  Hope you find something useful here.
