<p>After weeks of using my iBook, I have a working desktop again.  I ended up swapping hardware between my computer and my brother's computer, but I eventually got it working.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.mcdonaldsdorifto.com/">Roy</a> for the hardware.  I got an 18 gig(15k rpm)drive, card, cdr, and dvdrom, all of which are scsi.  He also gave me a new cpu.</p>
<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/">designing with web standards</a> the past couple of days, it's quite good.  I'd suggest it to anyone who's worked with web design for a few years.  It highlights good and bad designs(many of which I've done myself or had friends do).  Pushes towards xhtml and css, and a few of the approaches to that.  Atleast worth thumbing through.  On the downside I got a book on programming C#</p>
