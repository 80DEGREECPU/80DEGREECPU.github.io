title: Chromium and OpenGL
---
I came home from school today to find <a
HREF="http://www.reptilelabour.com/software/chromium/
">Chromium B.S.U</a> on freshmeat.  It's a really fun old-school shoot em up
sorta game, using gl, and openal.  If you have an nvidia card, you should check
this out because it's seriously fun.  The new nvidia drivers are much more
friendly to my dual head setup, I can now play quake3 on my Geforce2 GTS, while
leaving the other monitor up, and with apps open.  This is much doper than
having to log out of X whenever I wanna use GL, ie. evas, quake3, or chromium.
