For the last 18 months or so I've been using a "Cuisinart Grind & Brew":http://www.cuisinart.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi/en/item.cgi?item_id=DGB-600BC and I've absolutely hated it.  I had to clean the grinder after ever pot of coffee, and when you drink as much coffee as I do, it's a pain in the ass.  I recently stopped using the built in grinder and I've been more pleased with it, but for the most part the entire device is a let down.  

This Bunn coffee maker is dreamy.  This is the first coffee maker I've seen that doesn't have a hot plate under the caraffe(excluding french press, espresso machines etc).  You get the speed of a Bunn(3 minutes per pot) but you also get the efficiency of a thermos.  It brews straight into a thermos-like caraffe, so your pot is good for a few hours.  It's wonderful.
