title: kittens and lunix...
---
Ok, OS X was fun, but it's slow, I want lunix.  <a
HREF="http://www.linux.org">Lunix</a> on my ibook will be very dope.  My goal is
to get e17 working on my ibook.  OS X was being very kind to me, but I need this
<a href="http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/~cppx/">CPPX</a> stuff for <a
HREF="http://www.cs.memphis.edu/~sdml/">this</a> independent study I'm helping
with this summer at the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu">U of M</a>.  I hacked
myclock(that little truetype font clock thing i wrote with imlib2 a while back)
into e17 and have a nice little digital clock display integrated into my
desktop.  I got a kitten today, she's the runt of the litter my parents got a
cat from.  I named her Zelda, and hopefully I'll have pictures up in the
next day or so.  Summer school officially commences today at 10:50 am which is
in about 10 hours.  My summer vacation(all 3 weeks of it) has been kinda jam
packed with crap and I guess I'm ready to start taking classes again.  <a
HREF="http://www.vh1.com">VH1</a> got goatse'd the other day, it was hilarious
if you caught it.
