Never <B>EVER</B> transcribe video tape for something just because you can type.  
Since I'm always in need of money, someone offered to pay me to transcribe 5 hours of 
video tape.  I was presented with a monitor with a built in vcr and 5 tapes.  When I 
looked at the tapes they said ~2 hours.  Turns out it's 5 tapes, and ten hours of muffled 
talking and one person talking over another.  I really don't have much room to talk as 
I've only done 3 hours of tape so far, but I've spent 6 and a half hours getting those 
three hours of footage done.    I can not stress how frustrating and stupifying this act is.  
Return to Castle Wolfenstein came out with a multiplayer demo for Lunix last night, I've 
only played one map, but i think it was meant to be a model of the opening scene of 
saving private ryan.  Graphics look nice, and you can kill your teammates which is a 
definate plus.  Hopefully something exciting will come along in my life sometime soon.
