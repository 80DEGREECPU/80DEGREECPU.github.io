title: Strange Things

"Strange things are afoot at the circle K."

I went to Nashville TN last week to interview for a "rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com/ job.  The interview went really well, and I got word back today that they'd like me to come work with them(details hopefully hammered out in the next few days).  So hopefully in the next 2-3 weeks I'll be moving, working on something that interests me, and getting out of a work environment that's left me unfulfilled for quite a while.

Like the last time I took a job in a far off land, Allison will be lagging behind and hopefully following shortly after I get settled in.  I'm really not looking forward to the separation again, but I guess we'll just have to see how things pan out.  Much thanks to my friend "Roy":http://www.redx.be who's going to let me crash for the first few weeks.
