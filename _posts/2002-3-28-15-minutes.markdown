<p>Somebody recently told me "If you don't like the weather in Memphis, wait 15 minutes, it'll change."  They aren't really far off.  The weather here lately has gone from freezing ass cold to shorts and t-shirt weather. It's annoying.</p>
<p>My desktop machine still hasn't gotten fixed.  I've been using my ibook a shitload, but my webcam pic isn't even from this month I don't think.  Kristin turned 21 the other day, it was a flying saucer beer drinking event, it was cool to see a bunch of people I hadn't seen in a while.</p>
