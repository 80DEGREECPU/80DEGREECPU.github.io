title: Rainy Days
---
<p>Rainy days are by far my favorite.  Every once in a while it'll rain for a few days at a time.  I really enjoy walking around campus in the rain, stepping in or over puddles, stuff like that.  School is in full swing and I'm realizing I don't spend enough time on school work.  Quitting smoking really made it tough to sit down and get homework done.  I gave up quitting smoking again after two weeks, I'm weak.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.google.com">news.google.com</a> is a fantastic little resource.  The coolest thing being is it's an easy way for people to see WORLD news, not necessarily some of the news of the world, as reported by US media.  It refreshes itself, is relatively well organized, and comes with a neat little disclaimer: "This page was generated entirely by computer algorithms without human editors. No humans were harmed or even used in the creation of this page."  So if you give a shit, checkout it out.</p>
