title: Pilates Is Rugged

I feel kinda bad because Allison felt sick, but went anyways because I actually agreed to go.  She left about a half hour into it and thought she was going to throw up (not from the class).  I only made it through about 40 minutes of the hour long class, mainly because I felt bad for sweating profusely all over the "community" yoga mats.  Had I been someone coming into the next class and happened upon my mat I'd have been absolutely disgusted. :)  I did enjoy it a shitload more than weights and cardio type machines so I'll probably go again.
