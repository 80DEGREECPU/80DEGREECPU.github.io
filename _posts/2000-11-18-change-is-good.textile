title: Change is Good
---
I played with <a href="http://www.linuxbrit.org/gom/">gom</a> and <a href="http://www.pablotron.org/projects/rollover">Rollover</a> last night and came up with the navbar to the left. Some of the new things aren't rendering properly in Netscape, it renders much nicer in IE and Mozilla cause I'm using CSS now.  If you're using Netscape might I suggest picking up a copy of a nightly build of <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/">Mozilla</a> because it's a little more upto date than Netscape, and newer features render properly.  Now I'm debating toying with things some more or finding something else to do. If I've broken anything in the process lemme know. Now that I have the layout done, I guess I should start filling it with content....
