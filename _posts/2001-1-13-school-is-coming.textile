title: School is coming
---
School is starting on tuesday.  I redid most of the layout so it would look similar in all browsers, it looks cool in links now.  New logo and some of the links and stuff are changing.  Everything will prolly be broken until tommorow sometime.  <a href="http://slackware.com">Slackware 7.2</a> is out, and everyone should try it.  I prolly won't, but slackware is still dope.
