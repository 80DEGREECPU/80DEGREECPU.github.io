title: Learning as I go
---
So this clock idea is sort of coming together, I've got a screenshot up <a href="/shots/atmos-12-22-2000.png">here</a> and you can see it using the grunge ttf font in the bottom left corner.  There is still a lot of work I'd do to it before I would put it up for download and it's not the most impressive piece of software you've ever seen.  However I think it's useful, and I've learned quite a few things from building such a simple app.  When completed I want it to render truetype fonts, allow the user to specify the time format, font, background(or transparent), and possibly a few other things via an rc file.  I'd like to wish <a href="http://darius.dynodns.net">Allen</a> a quick recovery because his appendix randomly burst on him, he's doing a similar project right now using evas.   Just when you thought all the election bullshit was over someone sent me <a href="/pics/election.gif">this</a>, and oh yeah, I am a Jenius, with a capital J.
