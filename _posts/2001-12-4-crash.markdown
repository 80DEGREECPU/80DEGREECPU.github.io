title: Crash
---
Crash is a good word for today.  I think my neglect for sleep and proper diet 
finally took its tole on me.  I went to school to turn in my last English 
paper, and get ready to present our software development project but after 
about ten minutes of being there I started feeling <B>really</B> sick.  a few 
trips to the bathroom later left me knowing there was no way I could do 
anything today.  I let my software dev teacher there was no way I could make 
it to class, and after taking a look at me I think she knew I wasn't lying 
about being sick.  I'm really lucky to have an understanding teacher cause she 
could have easily just told me my grade was going to be screwed by not being 
at the group presentation.  So I went back out to my car and was going to drop 
my English paper off, but got lucky and saw the girl who sits next to me in 
that class, and she said she could turn it in for me.  I slept for most of the 
remainder of the day, and woke up to notice all of my clothes are dirty.  Our 
dryer is broken, at my sister's house where I live, and I had to drive out to 
my parent's house in order to wash my clothes.  So it's about 1am now and I 
have one load to finish drying before I go home and sleep some more.  Tomorrow 
will be filled with workmen fixing my heat and me hacking minix.  Shouldn't be 
too bad.
