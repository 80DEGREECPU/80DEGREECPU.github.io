title: Labor Days
---
True to form I took *0* photos of climbing.  I did however snap a few photos that aren't climbing which I'll prolly upload over the new few days.  I've come to the conclusion that I just shouldn't bring my digital rebel along when I go climbing.  It's just extra baggage or something that I'm paranoid will be stolen if left in the car.  I need something smaller and more practical for those kind of ventures.

We were schooled in some of the customs of "The Red":http://www.rrgcc.org/, mainly Miguel's, "Ale-8":http://www.ale-8-one.com/, and the beer trailer.  Miguel's is this pizza shop slash climber's commune.  All sorts of people wander in to camp out behind the shop, grab some gear, or simply stop in to grab some food.  You can swap stories with strangers about what you climbed that day, or what you're going to climb tomorrow.  We didn't stay there due to the overwhelming Labor Day crowd, we did however grab some pizza that I dug but Allison didn't.  Ale 8 is this ginger ale that people seem to swear by.  It was pretty good, but it's only available within a certain radius of Winchester Kentucky.  Most of the areas in the red are in a dry county, this is where the beer trailer comes into play.  It's about 50 yards outside of the county, and not too far from Miguel's.  It only really carries domestics, but they did carry some personal favorites "PBR":http://www.pabst.com/ and "Pete's Wicked":http://www.peteswicked.com/.

I was really impressed to see how organized the "Red River Gorge Climber's Coalition":http://www.rrgcc.org/ is.  They actually buy the land that the good climbing is on in the surrounding areas(if possible) to preserve it for generations to come.  It somehow feels 'open sourcy.' :)

I got comment spammed while I was away :(  Will see if I can see how folks are doing it, and maybe help out good ole typo in the process.
