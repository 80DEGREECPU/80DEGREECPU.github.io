title: Moving on ... to Engine Yard
---
I'm happy to report that I'm going to start working with the good folks at "Engine Yard":http://engineyard.com/ in 2 weeks.  I'll basically be trying to lighten the load that "Ezra":http://brainspl.at has been bearing by himself and learning all about how they're doing things over there.

I'm sad to report that I'll be leaving Centerstone in two weeks.  I started there just over a year ago and my life has changed so much in the last 12 months.  <em>Sooo Much</em>.  I have a lot of respect for everyone on my team at Centerstone for various reasons, and I'll really miss all of them.  I'm also giving notice 3 days before we go into user acceptance testing.  I know this is really going to hurt my team, but this was far too good of an opportunity to pass up.  I had a large leadership role there and am responsible for a lot of the good(and most of the bad) things in the system.  I got to help train and convert a Java shop to Rails and I got to grow immensely as a developer.

Mixed feelings aside, I have a grin from ear to ear.
