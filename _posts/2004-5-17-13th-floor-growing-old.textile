<p>Lots of time has passed since my last update, here's what's new.  Allison and I have been on a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000186/">David Lynch</a> kick lately.  We've seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166924/">Mullholland Drive</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278784/">Twin Peaks</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116922/">Lost Highway</a>.  They're <em>all</em> weird, but entertaining nonetheless.</p>
<p>I've gotten to make the wonderful leap from "dependent student" into "independent adult" recently.  I had to go migrate car ownership, residence, license, and my car insurance to all be under my name.  Throughout college these were all things that were "taken care of" by my parents.  What does this all mean?  It means I have more bills. :(  I did register to vote though...</p> 
<p>I've been playing <a href="http://www.pdga.com">disc golf</a> more lately since the weather has gotten nicer.  I've gotten some friends into it and almost always been able to find someone go to with me.  We frequent <a href="http://www.pdga.com/courses_by_city.php?id=1317">Johnson Road</a> and <a href="http://www.pdga.com/courses_by_city.php?id=509">Wall Doxey State Park</a>. I got my first hole in one the other day, first throw of the day. :)  I lost the disc a half hour later in a lake, there's no chance of getting it back.  :(  The greatest thing about disc golf aside from it being fun is that it's cheap or free.  There's no fee to play at Johnson Road, and playing at Wall Doxey is two dollars per car load of people.  This is perfect for my budget right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.enlightenment.org">E</a> coding hasn't been my major preoccupation recently.  I'm still trying to figure out a way to properly edje all of engage.  It's tricky and it means sucking in a large portion of the iconbar's functionality, breaking the osxish zooming(atleast temporarility), and a few other things.  I keep putting it off. :)  I worked with tokyo on themeing up a euphoria file dialog using esmart file dialog, this has gotten me back into using xmms2 and euphoria.  It's also given me quite a few ideas on how to enhance esmart file dialog.  Esmart is in libs now, it's gotten a namespace overhaul and should be lighter on memory since everything isn't being linked together as one big lib anymore.  There's prolly other code stuff that happened that I'm forgetting.</p>
