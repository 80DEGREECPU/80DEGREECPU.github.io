title: Exams are Done
---
I am so glad all my exams are done, I'll finally get some time to do a few things I've wanted to for a while.  a friend showed me <a href="/pics/bush-crack.jpg">this</a> which is pretty funny.  I'm prolly gonna start putting timestamps on the page over break because I'll have more browsing time over break.  Also might do a forum style thing for people to bitch, discuss ideas, argue or whatever, I'm not sure when I'll get around to it, but it may happen.
