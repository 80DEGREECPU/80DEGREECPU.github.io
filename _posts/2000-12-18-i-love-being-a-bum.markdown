title: I love being a bum
---
School being done for a few weeks is a wonderful gift, I get to sleep late, actually spend some time browsing, check out the source of the projects I'm interested in, or not do a damn thing if I see fit.  Few things I've found today are <a href="http://www.userlocal.com/interviews/cantrell121800/cantrell1.shtml">this</a> interview with David Cantrell of the <a href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware Linux</a> project, I used slack for a while, and really liked it, seems like they're doing cool things in their camp so it's cool to hear. Today I got <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">XFree86</a> working outta cvs and the how-to will be in the docs section later on tonight.  a few hours after I did that though, XFree-4.0.2 was released and currently the servers are full so check the <a href="http:/www.xfree86.org/MIRRORS.shtml">mirrors</a> if you want the source/binaries.
