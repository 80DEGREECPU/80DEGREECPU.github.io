title: myclock is borked
---
Whatever changes I made right before I released myclock-0.01 broke it, and it quits updating after about 45 minutes, it refreshes if you click on it, but it's still fucked in my opinion. For now just ignore it, I'm working with Allen right now on ekiris, which is the same thing but using evas.
