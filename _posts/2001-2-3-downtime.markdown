My motherboard fried itself earli
er this week.  So I was console life for a few
days.  I got a new Abit KT7A which is running really nicely in Linux-2.4 which
is what I'm running again.  Went to The Flying Saucer last night with <a
HREF="http://nothingkillsfaster.com">Niekze</a> last night, met a dope chick
from Rhodes College and beat all these drunk people in chess.  E-17 has a click
menu which makes it a little more viable to use, but I can't run dual monitors
with it because I have it setup to use GL.  That's it.
